Blobheart:command-r-plus,"[""\n1 Answer | Add Yours\nAlgeria was the first country to adopt communism as a way to develop its economy. Algeria was a French colony until 1962, when it gained its independence. In 1967, Algeria adopted a constitution that made the country a one-party state, with the National Liberation Front (FLN) as the only legal party. The FLN was a Marxist-Leninist party, and Algeria's government was modeled after the Soviet Union.
