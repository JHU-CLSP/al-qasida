""Online shopping is becoming more and more popular worldwide. In 2020, there were 256 million digital buyers in the United States alone — this number is supposed to increase by nearly 22 million by 2024. People shop online for a variety of reasons. Some shop online for convenience while others shop online for better insight into environmentally-friendly items/organizations. According to the Nielsen study, “Unpacking the Sustainability Landscape,” 73% of consumers are willing to change their ways to reduce the impact on the environment. There is a perception that e-commerce is a sustainable practice and the information below is meant to provide insight into the impacts of e-commerce on the environment.
Positive impacts on the environment
According to a 2011 International Conference on Environmental Science and Engineering study, there are several positive environmental impacts of e-commerce business models, and sustainable e-commerce models help attract customers.
Transportation emissions
E-commerce business models allow for organizations to conduct business without physically commuting. Transportation is responsible for a large number of harmful emissions/pollution, and by reducing your organization’s reliance on it, you can reduce your carbon footprint. Additionally, if e-commerce organizations allow employees to work from home, they can decrease their footprint even further.
Paper waste
Paper waste is created by most organizations. When information is transferred digitally, it reduces the need for the use of physical paper throughout the business. This can help reduce an organization’s footprint by reducing (or eliminating) paper waste. Paperless business models have a number of benefits and can be made possible using e-commerce capabilities.
Digital storage
The digital transfer of information paired with digital manufacturing could eliminate warehouses and create on-demand production. It is not exactly common knowledge among consumers at large, but warehouses can be an environmental issue. Warehouses consume large tracts of land and freight trucks traveling to and from them can create air pollutants, pavement/road damage, noise pollutants, and potential traffic safety issues.
Negative impacts on the environment
According to the same 2011 International Conference on Environmental Science and Engineering study mentioned above, it is stated that “although the potentials of the Internet to save material and energy cannot be denied, it is too early to conclude that e-commerce has only positive impacts on the environment. Each potential positive impact is coupled with a potentially overwhelming negative impact as well.” It should be noted that each e-commerce industry and its respective supply chain could pose its own challenges.
Transportation emissions
Even though e-commerce business models reduce the number of transportation emissions put into the air by their customers, their delivery trucks and other vehicles (e.g. planes) can still emit large amounts of harmful pollutants. Additionally, the location of the customer to the distribution center can make a large impact as well. Wholesale businesses are already primed for cutting down transportation emissions, but this is not always possible for businesses operating at different scales. Since there is a large emphasis on the importance of immediacy in business — especially in shipping offerings — businesses may have to send out freights that are only partially full. This will require additional trips and more transportation emissions.
Packaging
All shipped items require some degree of packaging, but the online shipping boom is creating a massive cardboard footprint from all of the materials used to ship. Additionally, organizations want to make sure their products are received in perfect condition. This can result in excessive padding techniques using styrofoam packing peanuts or additional paper. As mentioned above, immediacy is key. When people want something, they want it now, and this can result in buying a number of items one-at-a-time, rather than waiting and making a larger order. This can contribute to additional packaging waste. Although most packaging materials can be recycled, a 2018 EPA study on containers and packaging shows that out of the nearly 82,000 tons of containers and packaging generated in the U.S., only around half was recycled, and 30,000 tons went into a landfill.
Item returns
Not every customer is satisfied with an item that is shipped to them. For example, an item may not be the same as it appears online, it may not fit, something could have been broken in transit — there are a variety of possibilities that lead consumers to return the item. Item returns contribute negatively to the environment through both transportation emissions and packaging issues. If an item needs to be returned, it takes double the amount of transportation used to get the item to the consumer. If the item is exchanged for another item, you are tripling the amount of travel required for one item — essentially tripling the number of transportation emissions. If you ripped open the box, you may not be able to reuse the packaging. If you are exchanging an item, there is a possibility that the packaging will not be reused. At a minimum, there are three different paper shipping labels being used.
The future of sustainable e-commerce
The future of sustainable e-commerce can change daily due to dynamic e-commerce trends, but the primary focus should consider the following:
Sustainable packaging: Organizations need to create innovative packaging solutions. What a package is made out of is equally important to how it is made and the way it is shipped. You can reduce packaging size, find different sustainable packaging options online like compostable boxes, or even take an e-commerce packaging essentials class offered by the Sustainable Packaging Coalition to help design your own;
Sustainable shipping: As mentioned above, the demand for immediacy is at an all-time high, so it becomes even more important to figure out ways to cut back on the effects of shipping. Aside from creating more sustainable packaging, organizations can take advantage of paperless invoicing. Organizations can also create different shipping options for customers ordering multiple items like item consolidation. This helps by reducing the number of trips to the customer’s home and the number of boxes used to ship the items;
Supply chain integration: There are many diverse industries active in e-commerce, but they all have opportunities to reduce wastes and inefficiencies up and down the supply chain through smarter digital integration. Connecting all stakeholders, inputs, and information sources through a unified ERP system and powering savvier decision-making can be the key to unlocking a leaner, lower footprint supply chain. While business logistics and data management are often touted as beneficial to customer experience, the impact they can have on the supply chain through better communication and coordination may ultimately amount to more sustainable, tightly managed operations around the world;
Decreased energy waste: This category is broad and it encompasses a variety of business factors like switching to solar or outsourcing specific work locally, but there should be an immediate focus on transportation waste. For example, Amazon revealed its electric delivery van in an effort to produce zero net carbon by 2040. Organizations can also provide detailed product descriptions and shipping processes to help decrease the number of items returned/exchanged due to lack of information, or misunderstanding.""","[{'role': 'User', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Summarize the following article in 500 characters using Palestinian Arabic to answer the question ""How does e-commerce propel overconsumption?"".

""Online shopping is becoming more and more popular worldwide. In 2020, there were 256 million digital buyers in the United States alone — this number is supposed to increase by nearly 22 million by 2024. People shop online for a variety of reasons. Some shop online for convenience while others shop online for better insight into environmentally-friendly items/organizations. According to the Nielsen study, “Unpacking the Sustainability Landscape,” 73% of consumers are willing to change their ways to reduce the impact on the environment. There is a perception that e-commerce is a sustainable practice and the information below is meant to provide insight into the impacts of e-commerce on the environment.
Positive impacts on the environment
According to a 2011 International Conference on Environmental Science and Engineering study, there are several positive environmental impacts of e-commerce business models, and sustainable e-commerce models help attract customers.
Transportation emissions
E-commerce business models allow for organizations to conduct business without physically commuting. Transportation is responsible for a large number of harmful emissions/pollution, and by reducing your organization’s reliance on it, you can reduce your carbon footprint. Additionally, if e-commerce organizations allow employees to work from home, they can decrease their footprint even further.
Paper waste
Paper waste is created by most organizations. When information is transferred digitally, it reduces the need for the use of physical paper throughout the business. This can help reduce an organization’s footprint by reducing (or eliminating) paper waste. Paperless business models have a number of benefits and can be made possible using e-commerce capabilities.
Digital storage
The digital transfer of information paired with digital manufacturing could eliminate warehouses and create on-demand production. It is not exactly common knowledge among consumers at large, but warehouses can be an environmental issue. Warehouses consume large tracts of land and freight trucks traveling to and from them can create air pollutants, pavement/road damage, noise pollutants, and potential traffic safety issues.
Negative impacts on the environment
According to the same 2011 International Conference on Environmental Science and Engineering study mentioned above, it is stated that “although the potentials of the Internet to save material and energy cannot be denied, it is too early to conclude that e-commerce has only positive impacts on the environment. Each potential positive impact is coupled with a potentially overwhelming negative impact as well.” It should be noted that each e-commerce industry and its respective supply chain could pose its own challenges.
Transportation emissions
Even though e-commerce business models reduce the number of transportation emissions put into the air by their customers, their delivery trucks and other vehicles (e.g. planes) can still emit large amounts of harmful pollutants. Additionally, the location of the customer to the distribution center can make a large impact as well. Wholesale businesses are already primed for cutting down transportation emissions, but this is not always possible for businesses operating at different scales. Since there is a large emphasis on the importance of immediacy in business — especially in shipping offerings — businesses may have to send out freights that are only partially full. This will require additional trips and more transportation emissions.
Packaging
All shipped items require some degree of packaging, but the online shipping boom is creating a massive cardboard footprint from all of the materials used to ship. Additionally, organizations want to make sure their products are received in perfect condition. This can result in excessive padding techniques using styrofoam packing peanuts or additional paper. As mentioned above, immediacy is key. When people want something, they want it now, and this can result in buying a number of items one-at-a-time, rather than waiting and making a larger order. This can contribute to additional packaging waste. Although most packaging materials can be recycled, a 2018 EPA study on containers and packaging shows that out of the nearly 82,000 tons of containers and packaging generated in the U.S., only around half was recycled, and 30,000 tons went into a landfill.
Item returns
Not every customer is satisfied with an item that is shipped to them. For example, an item may not be the same as it appears online, it may not fit, something could have been broken in transit — there are a variety of possibilities that lead consumers to return the item. Item returns contribute negatively to the environment through both transportation emissions and packaging issues. If an item needs to be returned, it takes double the amount of transportation used to get the item to the consumer. If the item is exchanged for another item, you are tripling the amount of travel required for one item — essentially tripling the number of transportation emissions. If you ripped open the box, you may not be able to reuse the packaging. If you are exchanging an item, there is a possibility that the packaging will not be reused. At a minimum, there are three different paper shipping labels being used.
The future of sustainable e-commerce
The future of sustainable e-commerce can change daily due to dynamic e-commerce trends, but the primary focus should consider the following:
Sustainable packaging: Organizations need to create innovative packaging solutions. What a package is made out of is equally important to how it is made and the way it is shipped.

In total, your summary should come to between 200 and 300 words long. Each bullet point should begin with a key word extracted from the article.

“As Doritos, Walkers and Wotsits speed along a conveyor belt at Coventry's PepsiCo factory - where some of the UK's most popular crisps are made - the noise of whirring machinery is almost deafening.

But here, it's not just human workers trying to hear signs of machine failure above the factory fray.

Sensors attached to equipment are also listening out for indications of hardware faults, having been trained to recognise sounds of weary machines that risk bringing production lines to a grinding halt.

PepsiCo is deploying these sensors, created by tech firm Augury and powered by artificial intelligence (AI), across its factories following a successful US trial.

The company is one of many exploring how AI can increase factory efficiency, reduce waste and get products onto shelves sooner.

From early design to delivery, AI is seen as having a key role in a new wave of manufacturing.

Its ability to process and analyse huge volumes of data is already helping manufacturers predict and prepare for potential disruption.

A minute of factory downtime can cost companies thousands of pounds, and increased delays can mean missing out on consumer demand at critical moments like the festive period or Black Friday.

So tools that can check and analyse processes in real-time, warn of problems on the horizon, and harness historical data to recommend fixes are becoming familiar sights on factory floors.

The sensors used in PepsiCo factories have been trained on huge volumes of audio data, to be able to detect faults such as wearing on conveyor belts and bearings, while analysing machine vibrations.

""We have today over 300 million hours of machines that we've analysed and monitored, and we can leverage all this data to create algorithms that know how to pinpoint specific patterns of different malfunctions,"" says Augury chief executive, Saar Yoskovitz.

By also collecting information and insights into equipment health on the whole, such as identifying when a machine might fail again in future, the technology lets workers schedule maintenance in advance, and avoid having to react to machine errors as they occur.

Using AI-powered sensors can also give the company a way to cut down on waste across its operations.

""If the machine is working in the most optimal way you can reduce the energy consumption of that machine"", says Mr Yoskovitz.

Computer vision, which involves training machines to recognise objects in images and video, is another type of AI being used across some of the world's factories to detect product defects at-scale.

The flurry of items moving along conveyor belts and through sorting machines in factories mean miniscule defects in products can easily be missed.

This is particularly true of computer chip wafers and circuit boards that have intricate designs and components. Errors which might have previously gone unnoticed by the human eye can now be picked up by a machine's camera, and caught by algorithms trained to spot specific, surface-level anomalies.

Alexandra Brintrup, professor of digital manufacturing at the University of Cambridge's Institute for Manufacturing, tells the BBC that the use of AI for improving efficiency in the industry, including in areas like predictive maintenance and quality control, can now be considered conventional applications of the technology.

""I feel like the more exciting opportunities of AI in manufacturing are going to come from things that we couldn't even attempt to do before, like capacity sharing between manufacturers, improving visibility in supply chains, even sharing of trucks in a logistics chain,"" she says.

The interwoven, complex nature of supply chain networks, and the reluctance of some stakeholders to say who supplies them, has previously kept many aspects of manufacturing shrouded in mystery.

But AI can be used to analyse and predict who and where suppliers are, giving companies an insight into bottlenecks, and consumers an insight into where their products are coming from, and the materials used.

Prof Brintrup leads the Institute for Manufacturing's Supply Chain AI Lab, which has developed its own predictive mechanism to identify where ingredients such as palm oil may have been used in a product, but disguised under a different name on its label.

The lab's recent research suggested that palm oil can go by 200 different names in the US - and these might not stand out to eco-conscious consumers.

""We have increasingly a society that is very much aware of the environmental and societal impact of manufacturing, so I think increased supply chain visibility and giving that information to the consumer is going to become more and more important,"" Prof Brintrup adds.

The question of what the rising adoption of AI tools on factory floors and in the wider supply chain will mean for workers looms large over the manufacturing landscape.

Some firms are exploring how AI can be used to keep production line workers safe around machinery - using machine learning and computer vision techniques to monitor factory camera feeds to identify possible threats or accidents.

“As Doritos, Walkers and Wotsits speed along a conveyor belt at Coventry's PepsiCo factory - where some of the UK's most popular crisps are made - the noise of whirring machinery is almost deafening.

But here, it's not just human workers trying to hear signs of machine failure above the factory fray.

Sensors attached to equipment are also listening out for indications of hardware faults, having been trained to recognise sounds of weary machines that risk bringing production lines to a grinding halt.

PepsiCo is deploying these sensors, created by tech firm Augury and powered by artificial intelligence (AI), across its factories following a successful US trial.

The company is one of many exploring how AI can increase factory efficiency, reduce waste and get products onto shelves sooner.

From early design to delivery, AI is seen as having a key role in a new wave of manufacturing.

Its ability to process and analyse huge volumes of data is already helping manufacturers predict and prepare for potential disruption.

A minute of factory downtime can cost companies thousands of pounds, and increased delays can mean missing out on consumer demand at critical moments like the festive period or Black Friday.

So tools that can check and analyse processes in real-time, warn of problems on the horizon, and harness historical data to recommend fixes are becoming familiar sights on factory floors.

The sensors used in PepsiCo factories have been trained on huge volumes of audio data, to be able to detect faults such as wearing on conveyor belts and bearings, while analysing machine vibrations.

""We have today over 300 million hours of machines that we've analysed and monitored, and we can leverage all this data to create algorithms that know how to pinpoint specific patterns of different malfunctions,"" says Augury chief executive, Saar Yoskovitz.

By also collecting information and insights into equipment health on the whole, such as identifying when a machine might fail again in future, the technology lets workers schedule maintenance in advance, and avoid having to react to machine errors as they occur.

Using AI-powered sensors can also give the company a way to cut down on waste across its operations.

""If the machine is working in the most optimal way you can reduce the energy consumption of that machine"", says Mr Yoskovitz.

Computer vision, which involves training machines to recognise objects in images and video, is another type of AI being used across some of the world's factories to detect product defects at-scale.

The flurry of items moving along conveyor belts and through sorting machines in factories mean miniscule defects in products can easily be missed.

This is particularly true of computer chip wafers and circuit boards that have intricate designs and components. Errors which might have previously gone unnoticed by the human eye can now be picked up by a machine's camera, and caught by algorithms trained to spot specific, surface-level anomalies.

Alexandra Brintrup, professor of digital manufacturing at the University of Cambridge's Institute for Manufacturing, tells the BBC that the use of AI for improving efficiency in the industry, including in areas like predictive maintenance and quality control, can now be considered conventional applications of the technology.

""I feel like the more exciting opportunities of AI in manufacturing are going to come from things that we couldn't even attempt to do before, like capacity sharing between manufacturers, improving visibility in supply chains, even sharing of trucks in a logistics chain,"" she says.

The interwoven, complex nature of supply chain networks, and the reluctance of some stakeholders to say who supplies them, has previously kept many aspects of manufacturing shrouded in mystery.

But AI can be used to analyse and predict who and where suppliers are, giving companies an insight into bottlenecks, and consumers an insight into where their products are coming from, and the materials used.

Prof Brintrup leads the Institute for Manufacturing's Supply Chain AI Lab, which has developed its own predictive mechanism to identify where ingredients such as palm oil may have been used in a product, but disguised under a different name on its label.

The lab's recent research suggested that palm oil can go by 200 different names in the US - and these might not stand out to eco-conscious consumers.

""We have increasingly a society that is very much aware of the environmental and societal impact of manufacturing, so I think increased supply chain visibility and giving that information to the consumer is going to become more and more important,"" Prof Brintrup adds.

The question of what the rising adoption of AI tools on factory floors and in the wider supply chain will mean for workers looms large over the manufacturing landscape.

Some firms are exploring how AI can be used to keep production line workers safe around machinery - using machine learning and computer vision techniques to monitor factory camera feeds to identify possible threats or accidents.

Meanwhile, AI-powered wearables like exoskeletons have been deployed across UK warehouses to ensure people tasked with repeatedly carrying heavy loads aren't getting strained or injured.”","[{'role': 'User', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'In lay-person’s terms, briefly summarize the main points of the following article in a series of six bullet points.

Errors which might have previously gone unnoticed by the human eye can now be picked up by a machine\'s camera, and caught by algorithms trained to spot specific, surface-level anomalies.\n\nAlexandra Brintrup, professor of digital manufacturing at the University of Cambridge\'s Institute for Manufacturing, tells the BBC that the use of AI for improving efficiency in the industry, including in areas like predictive maintenance and quality control, can now be considered conventional applications of the technology.\n\n""I feel like the more exciting opportunities of AI in manufacturing are going to come from things that we couldn\'t even attempt to do before, like capacity sharing between manufacturers, improving visibility in supply chains, even sharing of trucks in a logistics chain,"" she says.\n\nThe interwoven, complex nature of supply chain networks, and the reluctance of some stakeholders to say who supplies them, has previously kept many aspects of manufacturing shrouded in mystery.\n\nBut AI can be used to analyse and predict who and where suppliers are, giving companies an insight into bottlenecks, and consumers an insight into where their products are coming from, and the materials used.\n\nProf Brintrup leads the Institute for Manufacturing\'s Supply Chain AI Lab, which has developed its own predictive mechanism to identify where ingredients such as palm oil may have been used in a product, but disguised under a different name on its label.\n\nThe lab\'s recent research suggested that palm oil can go by 200 different names in the US - and these might not stand out to eco-conscious consumers.\n\n""We have increasingly a society that is very much aware of the environmental and societal impact of manufacturing, so I think increased supply chain visibility and giving that information to the consumer is going to become more and more important,"" Prof Brintrup adds.\n\nThe question of what the rising adoption of AI tools on factory floors and in the wider supply chain will mean for workers looms large over the manufacturing landscape.\n\nSome firms are exploring how AI can be used to keep production line workers safe around machinery - using machine learning and computer vision techniques to monitor factory camera feeds to identify possible threats or accidents.\n\nMeanwhile, AI-powered wearables like exoskeletons have been deployed across UK warehouses to ensure people tasked with repeatedly carrying heavy loads aren\'t getting strained or injured.”\nReply in Palestinian Arabic.'}]}]",End,reply in {language_requested},Stand alone,5555,859,3,(),ar,pse,None,None,None,None

Predictive analytics is a powerful tool that organizations use to uncover insights and trends from data to make predictions about future events or behaviors. At its core, predictive analytics leverages sophisticated statistical techniques, machine learning algorithms, and modeling tools to analyze current and historical data, identify patterns, and construct predictive models. These models illuminate possibilities for what could happen, enabling businesses and stakeholders to make informed decisions and strategically plan for the future.

The process of predictive analytics typically involves several key steps. First, it requires gathering and preparing relevant data from various sources. This may include structured data from databases or unstructured data from texts, social media, and other sources. Cleaning, transforming, and integrating this data prepare it for analysis.

Once the data is ready, analysts employ statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to uncover relationships and patterns within the data. This stage involves methods such as data mining, regression analysis, clustering, and decision trees. By analyzing these patterns, analysts can build predictive models that simulate and understand the dynamics of the underlying system or process being analyzed.

These predictive models empower stakeholders to make informed decisions. For example, a retail company might use predictive models to forecast customer purchases, allowing them to optimize inventory levels and plan marketing strategies. Similarly, predictive analytics can aid in identifying potential risks and opportunities in the financial sector, optimizing pricing and maintenance schedules in the manufacturing industry, and personalizing recommendations in the healthcare industry.

The applications of predictive analytics are vast and continue to revolutionize industries and transform the way organizations operate. By harnessing the power of data and predictive models, businesses can make proactive decisions, stay ahead of the competition, and enhance their overall efficiency and effectiveness.","[{'role': 'User', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': ""Use Palestinian Arabic.

Article 1:

H1: The science of choosing a name


In the world of business, choosing names is important. The right name can increase consumer engagement, while the wrong name can alienate people. 


Recent research tells us that the spelling of a brand name also has a large impact on that brand’s image. 


In the last few years, the trend of “unconventional” spelling has been on the rise: this tactic was “the top brand naming trend” of 2021 (Costello et al, 2023). In an attempt to make a memorable name, some brands--like the ride sharing company “Lyft”--are intentionally misspelling words.


Just how effective is this strategy? Do consumers respond well to unconventionally-spelled brands and products? Yes and no. 


A recent study finds that unconventional spelling is desirable under certain conditions only. If these conditions are not met, consumers are unlikely to engage with an unconventionally-spelled brand. 


The rules of unconventional spelling can also be applied to performing artists, such as musicians. Instead of randomly choosing an alternative spelling for a stage name, artists can use alternative spelling to better create and portray their image.   




H2: What is unconventional spelling--and do consumers like it?


“Unconventional” spelling refers to the incorrect spelling of a recognizable word. Unconventional spelling can happen in three ways: 
Shortening the conventional spelling (i.e., Lil’ Debbie vs Little Debbie)
Lengthening the conventional spelling (Tripp vs. Trip) 
Substituting letters of the conventional spelling (Lyft vs. Lift)


A lot of brand strategists are telling their clients that unconventional spelling is a good idea (Costello et al, 2023). But is it? 


On the positive side, unconventionally spelled names are distinctive, which make them 
easy to trademark
memorable
trendy


According to a study done in 2023, however, unconventional spelling is not always seen favorably.


In the first part of the study, roughly 150 participants were given a choice to sample a product from two competing (and fictional) brands. In the follow-up experiment, over 300 participants shared their reactions to existing brand names--some of which were altered to use unconventional spelling. Participants in both experiments reacted more favorably to the conventionally-spelled names (Costello et al, 2023). 


Why is this the case? According to the researchers, “consumers perceive the choice of an unconventionally spelled name as an overt persuasion attempt by the marketer, and thus view the brand as less sincere” (Costello et al, 2023). In other words, people can tell when a brand uses unconventional spelling as a gimmick to get attention. And people don’t like it. 


H3: What are “good reasons” for choosing unconventional spelling?


Because “sincerity is one of the largest drivers of brand support” (Costello et al, 2023), brand strategists should make sure they have a valid reason for choosing an unconventional spelling. 


Theorists in the past have argued that unconventional spelling is a kind of rule-breaking, which consumers might see as “cool.” But the 2023 study finds that this attempt is easy to see through: consumers believe that cool brands don’t try to be cool (Costello et al, 2023).


In part of the experiment, participants were asked to share their feelings on the name of a made-up fitness app. Half of the 300 participants were told the app was called “Daily Gainz,” and the other half was told the app was called “Daily Gains.” Participants told researchers that the unconventionally-spelled version was “trying too hard” to be “cool and hip” (Costello et al, 2023). 


If the motive behind alternative spelling seems sincere, however, then consumers will look at this spelling more favorably. Researchers found (Costello et al, 2023) that consumers don’t mind unconventionally-spelled brands if:
the name was crowdsourced by people, rather than chosen by the company
the spelling is related to the brand’s history
the spelling was altered as a result of a trademark dispute


These are very specific scenarios. And surprisingly, none of them concern the relationship between the spelling of a brand and the product or service offered. This begs the question: if an alternative spelling is relevant enough, or meaningful enough, will audiences respond well? If the unconventional spelling “makes sense” with a brand, will people be more willing to support this brand?


H3: Why unconventional spelling should tell consumers something about the brand 


It’s possible that unconventionally-spelled names seem more sincere if the uniqueness of the spelling actually refers to the uniqueness of the brand. In other words, it might be better if unconventionally-spelled names for brands were associated with unique qualities of the brand. 


Research has shown that wordplay in slogans can foster the image, or personality, of the brand behind the slogan (Miller & Toman, 2016). Misspelling brand names in order to tell consumers something about the brand could count as wordplay. So, if these findings apply to brand names as well as slogans, then a clever or meaningful case of unconventional spelling can help create brand image.  


Consider the Canadian licensed cannabis producer “SunLeaf Farmacy.” The company substitutes letters to change “Pharmacy” to “Farmacy,” a difference that refers to the fact that the product is both “farmed” and “pharmaceutical.” 


In the above example, the reason for the wordplay is obvious (unlike “Lyft”). We know that consumers think unconventional spelling is sincere as long as there’s a good reason for it. So, consumers may look at SunLeaf Farmacy favorably because its unconventional spelling is directly related to the nature of the product.


The high exposure to advertising in everyday culture has led consumers to be incredibly skeptical of marketing tactics (Petrocelli et al, 2023). To many of these consumers, misspelling words for the goal of appearing trendy is little more than lying. Establishing a clear link between a brand’s spelling and a brand’s product is a simple way for a company to come across as sincere.

H2: How performers can use unconventional spelling to build image


The science of unconventional spelling doesn’t just apply to brand names. Just like a business, a performing artist needs a stage name that is both memorable and sincere.


A piece featured in the music magazine NME argues that artists re-invent their names to cultivate a persona, or narrative, that matches their musical style or personal values. Robert Zimmerman, according to the author, changed his name to Bob Dylan to project the image of a “train-hopping troubadour.” David Bowie adopted several stage personalities, all with different names, before he felt “able to become a rockstar” (Perry, 2015). 


But how can an artist know what stage name will convey the desired persona? Building on what we know about brand names, it’s possible that spelling has a lot to do with how effectively an artist can cultivate their persona. 


Just like brands, musicians can spell their stage name in a way that refers to a unique, memorable aspect of their performance. 


The artist P!nk, for example, substitutes the letter “i” for an exclamation mark. The exclamation mark not only resembles an inverted “i,” but also refers to the rebellious, louder-than-life attitude presented by the artist. 


The band Sixx:AM adds an “x” to the word “six” as a nod to the frontman, Nikki Sixx. Fans of the ex-Mötley Crüe member are promised the Nikki Sixx experience by the virtue of Sixx:AM’s name. 


The Beatles misspelled “Beetles” as a simple way to include the word “beat” in their band name. As one of the first four-piece rock bands to fill stadiums with dancing fans, the significance of the word “beat” is clear. 


If consumers expect a valid reason for businesses to spell a brand name unconventionally, then music fans might expect the same from the artists they follow. Audiences, therefore, could be more likely to follow performers whose names (and the spelling of those names) have a relevant connection to their act or image. 




H3: How to make unconventional spelling memorable and sincere


Brands and performers--and any other organizations that want followers--can benefit from choosing names that are memorable. And we know that unconventional spelling can make a name memorable. 


But we also know that consumers expect a sincere reason for unconventional spelling, beyond being memorable. 


A way to make unconventional spelling memorable and sincere is to have this spelling refer to a meaningful aspect of the organization in question. This “meaningful aspect” could involve the organization’s history--or it could involve the organization's product, services, or performance. 


In other words, creative spellings can make a lasting impression, and at the same time, tell consumers what a brand, band, or solo act is “all about.”


Article 2:

H1: How to present your case with certainty: the importance of the present tense


Communication is a central part to almost any job. Especially if the job involves convincing people. 


A researcher at a university wants to convince bursary organizations that a project is worth funding. A marketer wants to convince consumers that a particular brand product or service is worth buying. A politician wants to convince voters that a set of policies and values are worth supporting. 


Even in everyday conversation, we want to convince our listeners that our viewpoint is worth hearing.


What are some strategies that will get your audience to listen to you? People who study rhetoric will say that persuasion is a subtle art, full of complex rules. Behavioral psychologists will tell you that in order to be convincing, you need to know how people think. 


But if we don’t want to study the deep mysteries of language and mind, we can get people to listen to us with a simple rule. According to a set of studies from 2023, people who speak or write in the present tense sound more certain. Certainty is persuasive (Packard et al, 2023).


In other words, using present tense is sort of a communication “life hack” to instantly boost persuasiveness. This finding raises some questions: 
Why does using the present tense bolster certainty?
Who can benefit most from this life hack? 
How can we use this life hack responsibly? 



H2: Why does the present tense make us sound certain?


Of all the things to affect our perceived sense of certainty, how much of a difference can verb tense make? 

To find out, researchers looked at over 500,000 product reviews on Amazon. The study found that the reviews that used presence tense were graded “helpful” far more often than the views using past tense. Another follow-up experiment in the study found that the “tense effect” applies to word-of-mouth reviews--i.e., conversations between people (Packard et al, 2023). 

What is behind the link between verb tense and helpfulness? 

The present tense makes a statement sound true all the time. “One of verbs’ key roles is telling time,” write the authors. “Saying ‘France was fun’ implies that the content hinges on a particular, potentially idiosyncratic experience … using past tense to express attitudes suggests a degree of subjectivity” (Packard et al, 2023).

In other words, using past tense to make a claim makes that claim conditional. Someone who hears or reads the above claim--”France was fun”-- might wonder, “will France be fun when I go? Is France fun for everyone, all the time?”

On the other hand, the present tense is “generalizable or universal.” Saying that France is fun implies that this statement “is a genuine and active part of current reality” (Packard et al, 2023). The present tense, in other words, suggests that a claim is true under any conditions, and will remain true under any conditions. “Such certainty suggests that an attitude is true not only for the person who holds it but for other people as well” (Packard et al, 2023). 

It  may seem like a small detail of communication, but the present tense has the power to imply unconditional truth. This is a powerful rhetorical ability. 

H3: How present tense can give unheard people a stronger voice


The value of sounding persuasive is obvious for marketers. Saying “this product is what you need” is more effective than saying “this product will be what you need.” There is no uncertainty with the former, while the latter is conditional. 


Sounding convincing is especially important in a time when trust in corporations is low (Petrocelli, 2023). In a 2023 study, researchers find that the world of online personalities, pop-up ads, and influencers creates an environment “in which it is difficult, if not impossible, to assess the credibility of source information” (Petrocelli, 2023). To cut through the chatter, it’s best to use language that leaves little-to-no room for uncertainty: i.e., the present tense. 


However useful this communications “life hack” might be for selling stuff, it might be most beneficial to those groups who need to be heard. 


Decades of research tells us that women are perceived as being less assertive than their male counterparts. This perceived lack of assertiveness poses a barrier to women seeking positions of leadership (Kulkarni & Mishra, 2022). 


Using the present tense to convey ideas, claims, and arguments can help get people to listen. Sounding more certain, and thus more persuasive, could allow women (and any other groups that go unheard) to overcome long standing barriers in the professional world. 


No marginalized group should have to tailor their communication style to match the dominant group. But as we wait for social roles to be dismantled completely, language use is a relatively easy--and very effective--way to change perceptions. 


H2: Can convincing language make positive social change? 


If the above section tells us anything, it’s that language can be used to make positive social change. This is why the use of present tense language could be particularly helpful in activism. 


Trying to convince people that climate change or social injustice are real (and dangerous) usually involves citing facts and statistics. A climate activist might say, “X tons of greenhouse gas are released by the transportation sector every year. Here are ways we could change the transport infrastructure to reduce emissions.”


The activist might be using the less-certain tense because they are citing science, and science avoids making categorical claims. Typically, science reveals “correlations” or “links” between a variable and an observable effect. The lack of “absolute” language in scientific communications is a very real barrier to climate action (Freudenburg & Muselli, 2013).


We know that a climate activist would be more convincing if they say, “changing transportation infrastructure eliminates X tons of greenhouse emissions per year.” Saying “will eliminate” or “could eliminate” merely clouds the urgency of the message.


We can also see the power of present tense in speeches, poetry, and music. The song “We are Winning,” by the hip-hop group Flobots, is a great example of how verb tense affects the potency of a message. The song is about waging a mental war on the forces seeking to keep the masses from taking ownership of our own power. Consider these lyrics:


Roses sprout from empty lots and sidewalk cracks
Pacifist guerrillas move undetected through concrete jungles
New forms are beginning to take shape
Once-occupied minds are activating
People are waking up
The insurgency is alive and well (Flobots, 2007)


The song would not communicate the same meaning if the lyricists had said, “minds will activate,” or “the insurgency will be alive and well.” The song would not land the same way if it were called “We will win.” The repeated present tense makes listeners feel as though positive change is happening right now. It also makes listeners feel like they are part of this change.




H2: When is the right time to sound convincing?


When it comes to making a persuasive point, it’s not really useful to draw attention to the conditional, subjective, or unknown aspects of your argument. 


Issues like climate destruction are pressing. Therefore, it’s important to persuade people that there are real problems, with real solutions. It could be worth it to sacrifice full accuracy for certainty when the stakes are particularly high--and time-sensitive.


However, leaving out the conditional or subjective aspects of a claim is not the same as making up facts to support a claim. 


So, before we take our communications life hack and run with it, we should note that many people who aim to sound convincing are not interested in noble causes like climate activism or social change. Someone who successfully uses strong, present tense verbs could be advancing an agenda based on lies and misinformation. In this way, rhetorical “hacks” can be dangerous.


Certain politicians, for instance, are very good at sounding assured--even when they are completely wrong about the facts. Even if it’s not their intent to lie, many leaders speak “with little to no concern for truth” in their attempt to sound convincing. Applied cognitive psychologists describe these people as “bullsh***ers” (Petrocelli et al, 2023).


H3: The responsibilities of sounding convincing


Using the present tense can help people sound like they know what they’re talking about. But is it okay to use communication strategies that make you sound convincing when you don’t know what you’re talking about--when you’re bullsh***ing? 


It’s possible that presenting a case with the “universal” truth of the present tense incurs a certain amount of responsibility to be factual.


In other words, it’s acceptable to say “zero-emission transportation eliminates huge amounts of greenhouse gas,” even though this claim technically depends on things like which zero-emission technology we use. It’s not acceptable to say, “the climate is perfectly fine.”


If you can back up certainty with fact, in other words, then use whatever rhetorical tools you need to sound certain.

The right name can increase consumer engagement, while the wrong name can alienate people. \n\n\nRecent research tells us that the spelling of a brand name also has a large impact on that brand’s image. \n\n\nIn the last few years, the trend of “unconventional” spelling has been on the rise: this tactic was “the top brand naming trend” of 2021 (Costello et al, 2023). In an attempt to make a memorable name, some brands--like the ride sharing company “Lyft”--are intentionally misspelling words.\n\n\nJust how effective is this strategy? Do consumers respond well to unconventionally-spelled brands and products? Yes and no. \n\n\nA recent study finds that unconventional spelling is desirable under certain conditions only. If these conditions are not met, consumers are unlikely to engage with an unconventionally-spelled brand. \n\n\nThe rules of unconventional spelling can also be applied to performing artists, such as musicians. Instead of randomly choosing an alternative spelling for a stage name, artists can use alternative spelling to better create and portray their image.   \n\n\n\n\nH2: What is unconventional spelling--and do consumers like it?\n\n\n“Unconventional” spelling refers to the incorrect spelling of a recognizable word. Unconventional spelling can happen in three ways: \nShortening the conventional spelling (i.e., Lil’ Debbie vs Little Debbie)\nLengthening the conventional spelling (Tripp vs. Trip) \nSubstituting letters of the conventional spelling (Lyft vs. Lift)\n\n\nA lot of brand strategists are telling their clients that unconventional spelling is a good idea (Costello et al, 2023). But is it? \n\n\nOn the positive side, unconventionally spelled names are distinctive, which make them \neasy to trademark\nmemorable\ntrendy\n\n\nAccording to a study done in 2023, however, unconventional spelling is not always seen favorably.\n\n\nIn the first part of the study, roughly 150 participants were given a choice to sample a product from two competing (and fictional) brands. In the follow-up experiment, over 300 participants shared their reactions to existing brand names--some of which were altered to use unconventional spelling. Participants in both experiments reacted more favorably to the conventionally-spelled names (Costello et al, 2023). \n\n\nWhy is this the case? According to the researchers, “consumers perceive the choice of an unconventionally spelled name as an overt persuasion attempt by the marketer, and thus view the brand as less sincere” (Costello et al, 2023). In other words, people can tell when a brand uses unconventional spelling as a gimmick to get attention. And people don’t like it. \n\n\nH3: What are “good reasons” for choosing unconventional spelling?\n\n\nBecause “sincerity is one of the largest drivers of brand support” (Costello et al, 2023), brand strategists should make sure they have a valid reason for choosing an unconventional spelling. \n\n\nTheorists in the past have argued that unconventional spelling is a kind of rule-breaking, which consumers might see as “cool.” But the 2023 study finds that this attempt is easy to see through: consumers believe that cool brands don’t try to be cool (Costello et al, 2023).\n\n\nIn part of the experiment, participants were asked to share their feelings on the name of a made-up fitness app. Half of the 300 participants were told the app was called “Daily Gainz,” and the other half was told the app was called “Daily Gains.” Participants told researchers that the unconventionally-spelled version was “trying too hard” to be “cool and hip” (Costello et al, 2023). \n\n\nIf the motive behind alternative spelling seems sincere, however, then consumers will look at this spelling more favorably. Researchers found (Costello et al, 2023) that consumers don’t mind unconventionally-spelled brands if:\nthe name was crowdsourced by people, rather than chosen by the company\nthe spelling is related to the brand’s history\nthe spelling was altered as a result of a trademark dispute\n\n\nThese are very specific scenarios. And surprisingly, none of them concern the relationship between the spelling of a brand and the product or service offered. This begs the question: if an alternative spelling is relevant enough, or meaningful enough, will audiences respond well? If the unconventional spelling “makes sense” with a brand, will people be more willing to support this brand?\n\n\nH3: Why unconventional spelling should tell consumers something about the brand \n\n\nIt’s possible that unconventionally-spelled names seem more sincere if the uniqueness of the spelling actually refers to the uniqueness of the brand. In other words, it might be better if unconventionally-spelled names for brands were associated with unique qualities of the brand. \n\n\nResearch has shown that wordplay in slogans can foster the image, or personality, of the brand behind the slogan (Miller & Toman, 2016). Misspelling brand names in order to tell consumers something about the brand could count as wordplay. So, if these findings apply to brand names as well as slogans, then a clever or meaningful case of unconventional spelling can help create brand image.  \n\n\nConsider the Canadian licensed cannabis producer “SunLeaf Farmacy.” The company substitutes letters to change “Pharmacy” to “Farmacy,” a difference that refers to the fact that the product is both “farmed” and “pharmaceutical.” \n\n\nIn the above example, the reason for the wordplay is obvious (unlike “Lyft”). We know that consumers think unconventional spelling is sincere as long as there’s a good reason for it. So, consumers may look at SunLeaf Farmacy favorably because its unconventional spelling is directly related to the nature of the product.\n\n\nThe high exposure to advertising in everyday culture has led consumers to be incredibly skeptical of marketing tactics (Petrocelli et al, 2023). To many of these consumers, misspelling words for the goal of appearing trendy is little more than lying. Establishing a clear link between a brand’s spelling and a brand’s product is a simple way for a company to come across as sincere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nH2: How performers can use unconventional spelling to build image\n\n\nThe science of unconventional spelling doesn’t just apply to brand names. Just like a business, a performing artist needs a stage name that is both memorable and sincere.\n\n\nA piece featured in the music magazine NME argues that artists re-invent their names to cultivate a persona, or narrative, that matches their musical style or personal values. Robert Zimmerman, according to the author, changed his name to Bob Dylan to project the image of a “train-hopping troubadour.” David Bowie adopted several stage personalities, all with different names, before he felt “able to become a rockstar” (Perry, 2015). \n\n\nBut how can an artist know what stage name will convey the desired persona? Building on what we know about brand names, it’s possible that spelling has a lot to do with how effectively an artist can cultivate their persona. \n\n\nJust like brands, musicians can spell their stage name in a way that refers to a unique, memorable aspect of their performance. \n\n\nThe artist P!nk, for example, substitutes the letter “i” for an exclamation mark. The exclamation mark not only resembles an inverted “i,” but also refers to the rebellious, louder-than-life attitude presented by the artist. \n\n\nThe band Sixx:AM adds an “x” to the word “six” as a nod to the frontman, Nikki Sixx. Fans of the ex-Mötley Crüe member are promised the Nikki Sixx experience by the virtue of Sixx:AM’s name. \n\n\nThe Beatles misspelled “Beetles” as a simple way to include the word “beat” in their band name. As one of the first four-piece rock bands to fill stadiums with dancing fans, the significance of the word “beat” is clear. \n\n\nIf consumers expect a valid reason for businesses to spell a brand name unconventionally, then music fans might expect the same from the artists they follow. Audiences, therefore, could be more likely to follow performers whose names (and the spelling of those names) have a relevant connection to their act or image. \n\n\n\n\nH3: How to make unconventional spelling memorable and sincere\n\n\nBrands and performers--and any other organizations that want followers--can benefit from choosing names that are memorable. And we know that unconventional spelling can make a name memorable. \n\n\nBut we also know that consumers expect a sincere reason for unconventional spelling, beyond being memorable. \n\n\nA way to make unconventional spelling memorable and sincere is to have this spelling refer to a meaningful aspect of the organization in question. This “meaningful aspect” could involve the organization’s history--or it could involve the organization\'s product, services, or performance. \n\n\nIn other words, creative spellings can make a lasting impression, and at the same time, tell consumers what a brand, band, or solo act is “all about.”\n\n\nArticle 2:\n\nH1: How to present your case with certainty: the importance of the present tense\n\n\nCommunication is a central part to almost any job. Especially if the job involves convincing people. \n\n\nA researcher at a university wants to convince bursary organizations that a project is worth funding. A marketer wants to convince consumers that a particular brand product or service is worth buying. A politician wants to convince voters that a set of policies and values are worth supporting. \n\n\nEven in everyday conversation, we want to convince our listeners that our viewpoint is worth hearing.\n\n\nWhat are some strategies that will get your audience to listen to you? People who study rhetoric will say that persuasion is a subtle art, full of complex rules. Behavioral psychologists will tell you that in order to be convincing, you need to know how people think. \n\n\nBut if we don’t want to study the deep mysteries of language and mind, we can get people to listen to us with a simple rule. According to a set of studies from 2023, people who speak or write in the present tense sound more certain. Certainty is persuasive (Packard et al, 2023).\n\n\nIn other words, using present tense is sort of a communication “life hack” to instantly boost persuasiveness. This finding raises some questions: \nWhy does using the present tense bolster certainty?\nWho can benefit most from this life hack? \nHow can we use this life hack responsibly? \n\n\n\nH2: Why does the present tense make us sound certain?\n\n\nOf all the things to affect our perceived sense of certainty, how much of a difference can verb tense make? \n\nTo find out, researchers looked at over 500,000 product reviews on Amazon. The study found that the reviews that used presence tense were graded “helpful” far more often than the views using past tense. Another follow-up experiment in the study found that the “tense effect” applies to word-of-mouth reviews--i.e., conversations between people (Packard et al, 2023). \n\nWhat is behind the link between verb tense and helpfulness? \n\nThe present tense makes a statement sound true all the time. “One of verbs’ key roles is telling time,” write the authors. “Saying ‘France was fun’ implies that the content hinges on a particular, potentially idiosyncratic experience … using past tense to express attitudes suggests a degree of subjectivity” (Packard et al, 2023).\n\nIn other words, using past tense to make a claim makes that claim conditional. Someone who hears or reads the above claim--”France was fun”-- might wonder, “will France be fun when I go? Is France fun for everyone, all the time?”\n\nOn the other hand, the present tense is “generalizable or universal.” Saying that France is fun implies that this statement “is a genuine and active part of current reality” (Packard et al, 2023). The present tense, in other words, suggests that a claim is true under any conditions, and will remain true under any conditions. “Such certainty suggests that an attitude is true not only for the person who holds it but for other people as well” (Packard et al, 2023). \n\nIt  may seem like a small detail of communication, but the present tense has the power to imply unconditional truth. This is a powerful rhetorical ability. \n\nH3: How present tense can give unheard people a stronger voice\n\n\nThe value of sounding persuasive is obvious for marketers. Saying “this product is what you need” is more effective than saying “this product will be what you need.” There is no uncertainty with the former, while the latter is conditional. \n\n\nSounding convincing is especially important in a time when trust in corporations is low (Petrocelli, 2023). In a 2023 study, researchers find that the world of online personalities, pop-up ads, and influencers creates an environment “in which it is difficult, if not impossible, to assess the credibility of source information” (Petrocelli, 2023). To cut through the chatter, it’s best to use language that leaves little-to-no room for uncertainty: i.e., the present tense. \n\n\nHowever useful this communications “life hack” might be for selling stuff, it might be most beneficial to those groups who need to be heard. \n\n\nDecades of research tells us that women are perceived as being less assertive than their male counterparts. This perceived lack of assertiveness poses a barrier to women seeking positions of leadership (Kulkarni & Mishra, 2022). \n\n\nUsing the present tense to convey ideas, claims, and arguments can help get people to listen. Sounding more certain, and thus more persuasive, could allow women (and any other groups that go unheard) to overcome long standing barriers in the professional world. \n\n\nNo marginalized group should have to tailor their communication style to match the dominant group. But as we wait for social roles to be dismantled completely, language use is a relatively easy--and very effective--way to change perceptions. \n\n\nH2: Can convincing language make positive social change? \n\n\nIf the above section tells us anything, it’s that language can be used to make positive social change. This is why the use of present tense language could be particularly helpful in activism. \n\n\nTrying to convince people that climate change or social injustice are real (and dangerous) usually involves citing facts and statistics. A climate activist might say, “X tons of greenhouse gas are released by the transportation sector every year. Here are ways we could change the transport infrastructure to reduce emissions.”\n\n\nThe activist might be using the less-certain tense because they are citing science, and science avoids making categorical claims. Typically, science reveals “correlations” or “links” between a variable and an observable effect. The lack of “absolute” language in scientific communications is a very real barrier to climate action (Freudenburg & Muselli, 2013).\n\n\nWe know that a climate activist would be more convincing if they say, “changing transportation infrastructure eliminates X tons of greenhouse emissions per year.” Saying “will eliminate” or “could eliminate” merely clouds the urgency of the message.\n\n\nWe can also see the power of present tense in speeches, poetry, and music. The song “We are Winning,” by the hip-hop group Flobots, is a great example of how verb tense affects the potency of a message. The song is about waging a mental war on the forces seeking to keep the masses from taking ownership of our own power. Consider these lyrics:\n\n\nRoses sprout from empty lots and sidewalk cracks\nPacifist guerrillas move undetected through concrete jungles\nNew forms are beginning to take shape\nOnce-occupied minds are activating\nPeople are waking up\nThe insurgency is alive and well (Flobots, 2007)\n\n\nThe song would not communicate the same meaning if the lyricists had said, “minds will activate,” or “the insurgency will be alive and well.” The song would not land the same way if it were called “We will win.” The repeated present tense makes listeners feel as though positive change is happening right now. It also makes listeners feel like they are part of this change.\n\n\n\n\nH2: When is the right time to sound convincing?\n\n\nWhen it comes to making a persuasive point, it’s not really useful to draw attention to the conditional, subjective, or unknown aspects of your argument. \n\n\nIssues like climate destruction are pressing. Therefore, it’s important to persuade people that there are real problems, with real solutions. It could be worth it to sacrifice full accuracy for certainty when the stakes are particularly high--and time-sensitive.\n\n\nHowever, leaving out the conditional or subjective aspects of a claim is not the same as making up facts to support a claim. \n\n\nSo, before we take our communications life hack and run with it, we should note that many people who aim to sound convincing are not interested in noble causes like climate activism or social change. Someone who successfully uses strong, present tense verbs could be advancing an agenda based on lies and misinformation. In this way, rhetorical “hacks” can be dangerous.\n\n\nCertain politicians, for instance, are very good at sounding assured--even when they are completely wrong about the facts. Even if it’s not their intent to lie, many leaders speak “with little to no concern for truth” in their attempt to sound convincing. Applied cognitive psychologists describe these people as “bullsh***ers” (Petrocelli et al, 2023).\n\n\nH3: The responsibilities of sounding convincing\n\n\nUsing the present tense can help people sound like they know what they’re talking about. But is it okay to use communication strategies that make you sound convincing when you don’t know what you’re talking about--when you’re bullsh***ing? \n\n\nIt’s possible that presenting a case with the “universal” truth of the present tense incurs a certain amount of responsibility to be factual.\n\n\nIn other words, it’s acceptable to say “zero-emission transportation eliminates huge amounts of greenhouse gas,” even though this claim technically depends on things like which zero-emission technology we use. It’s not acceptable to say, “the climate is perfectly fine.”\n\n\nIf you can back up certainty with fact, in other words, then use whatever rhetorical tools you need to sound certain. It’s okay for businesses, politicians, artists, and activists to bolster their sense of certainty with the present tense--as long as the core premise of their claims is valid.'}]}]",Start,write in {language_requested},Stand alone,18666,2921,3,(),ar,pse,None,None,None,None

Article 1:

H1: The science of choosing a name


In the world of business, choosing names is important. The right name can increase consumer engagement, while the wrong name can alienate people. 


Recent research tells us that the spelling of a brand name also has a large impact on that brand’s image. 


In the last few years, the trend of “unconventional” spelling has been on the rise: this tactic was “the top brand naming trend” of 2021 (Costello et al, 2023). In an attempt to make a memorable name, some brands--like the ride sharing company “Lyft”--are intentionally misspelling words.


Just how effective is this strategy? Do consumers respond well to unconventionally-spelled brands and products? Yes and no. 


A recent study finds that unconventional spelling is desirable under certain conditions only. If these conditions are not met, consumers are unlikely to engage with an unconventionally-spelled brand. 


The rules of unconventional spelling can also be applied to performing artists, such as musicians. Instead of randomly choosing an alternative spelling for a stage name, artists can use alternative spelling to better create and portray their image.   




H2: What is unconventional spelling--and do consumers like it?


“Unconventional” spelling refers to the incorrect spelling of a recognizable word. Unconventional spelling can happen in three ways: 
Shortening the conventional spelling (i.e., Lil’ Debbie vs Little Debbie)
Lengthening the conventional spelling (Tripp vs. Trip) 
Substituting letters of the conventional spelling (Lyft vs. Lift)


A lot of brand strategists are telling their clients that unconventional spelling is a good idea (Costello et al, 2023). But is it? 


On the positive side, unconventionally spelled names are distinctive, which make them 
easy to trademark
memorable
trendy


According to a study done in 2023, however, unconventional spelling is not always seen favorably.


In the first part of the study, roughly 150 participants were given a choice to sample a product from two competing (and fictional) brands. In the follow-up experiment, over 300 participants shared their reactions to existing brand names--some of which were altered to use unconventional spelling. Participants in both experiments reacted more favorably to the conventionally-spelled names (Costello et al, 2023). 


Why is this the case? According to the researchers, “consumers perceive the choice of an unconventionally spelled name as an overt persuasion attempt by the marketer, and thus view the brand as less sincere” (Costello et al, 2023). In other words, people can tell when a brand uses unconventional spelling as a gimmick to get attention. And people don’t like it. 


H3: What are “good reasons” for choosing unconventional spelling?


Because “sincerity is one of the largest drivers of brand support” (Costello et al, 2023), brand strategists should make sure they have a valid reason for choosing an unconventional spelling. 


Theorists in the past have argued that unconventional spelling is a kind of rule-breaking, which consumers might see as “cool.” But the 2023 study finds that this attempt is easy to see through: consumers believe that cool brands don’t try to be cool (Costello et al, 2023).


In part of the experiment, participants were asked to share their feelings on the name of a made-up fitness app. Half of the 300 participants were told the app was called “Daily Gainz,” and the other half was told the app was called “Daily Gains.” Participants told researchers that the unconventionally-spelled version was “trying too hard” to be “cool and hip” (Costello et al, 2023). 


If the motive behind alternative spelling seems sincere, however, then consumers will look at this spelling more favorably. Researchers found (Costello et al, 2023) that consumers don’t mind unconventionally-spelled brands if:
the name was crowdsourced by people, rather than chosen by the company
the spelling is related to the brand’s history
the spelling was altered as a result of a trademark dispute


These are very specific scenarios. And surprisingly, none of them concern the relationship between the spelling of a brand and the product or service offered. This begs the question: if an alternative spelling is relevant enough, or meaningful enough, will audiences respond well? If the unconventional spelling “makes sense” with a brand, will people be more willing to support this brand?


H3: Why unconventional spelling should tell consumers something about the brand 


It’s possible that unconventionally-spelled names seem more sincere if the uniqueness of the spelling actually refers to the uniqueness of the brand. In other words, it might be better if unconventionally-spelled names for brands were associated with unique qualities of the brand. 


Research has shown that wordplay in slogans can foster the image, or personality, of the brand behind the slogan (Miller & Toman, 2016). Misspelling brand names in order to tell consumers something about the brand could count as wordplay. So, if these findings apply to brand names as well as slogans, then a clever or meaningful case of unconventional spelling can help create brand image.  


Consider the Canadian licensed cannabis producer “SunLeaf Farmacy.” The company substitutes letters to change “Pharmacy” to “Farmacy,” a difference that refers to the fact that the product is both “farmed” and “pharmaceutical.” 


In the above example, the reason for the wordplay is obvious (unlike “Lyft”). We know that consumers think unconventional spelling is sincere as long as there’s a good reason for it. So, consumers may look at SunLeaf Farmacy favorably because its unconventional spelling is directly related to the nature of the product.


The high exposure to advertising in everyday culture has led consumers to be incredibly skeptical of marketing tactics (Petrocelli et al, 2023). To many of these consumers, misspelling words for the goal of appearing trendy is little more than lying. Establishing a clear link between a brand’s spelling and a brand’s product is a simple way for a company to come across as sincere.








.


H2: How performers can use unconventional spelling to build image


The science of unconventional spelling doesn’t just apply to brand names. Just like a business, a performing artist needs a stage name that is both memorable and sincere.


A piece featured in the music magazine NME argues that artists re-invent their names to cultivate a persona, or narrative, that matches their musical style or personal values. Robert Zimmerman, according to the author, changed his name to Bob Dylan to project the image of a “train-hopping troubadour.” David Bowie adopted several stage personalities, all with different names, before he felt “able to become a rockstar” (Perry, 2015). 


But how can an artist know what stage name will convey the desired persona? Building on what we know about brand names, it’s possible that spelling has a lot to do with how effectively an artist can cultivate their persona. 


Just like brands, musicians can spell their stage name in a way that refers to a unique, memorable aspect of their performance. 


The artist P!nk, for example, substitutes the letter “i” for an exclamation mark. The exclamation mark not only resembles an inverted “i,” but also refers to the rebellious, louder-than-life attitude presented by the artist. 


The band Sixx:AM adds an “x” to the word “six” as a nod to the frontman, Nikki Sixx. Fans of the ex-Mötley Crüe member are promised the Nikki Sixx experience by the virtue of Sixx:AM’s name. 


The Beatles misspelled “Beetles” as a simple way to include the word “beat” in their band name. As one of the first four-piece rock bands to fill stadiums with dancing fans, the significance of the word “beat” is clear. 


If consumers expect a valid reason for businesses to spell a brand name unconventionally, then music fans might expect the same from the artists they follow. Audiences, therefore, could be more likely to follow performers whose names (and the spelling of those names) have a relevant connection to their act or image. 




H3: How to make unconventional spelling memorable and sincere


Brands and performers--and any other organizations that want followers--can benefit from choosing names that are memorable. And we know that unconventional spelling can make a name memorable. 


But we also know that consumers expect a sincere reason for unconventional spelling, beyond being memorable. 


A way to make unconventional spelling memorable and sincere is to have this spelling refer to a meaningful aspect of the organization in question. This “meaningful aspect” could involve the organization’s history--or it could involve the organization's product, services, or performance. 


In other words, creative spellings can make a lasting impression, and at the same time, tell consumers what a brand, band, or solo act is “all about.”


Article 2:

H1: How to present your case with certainty: the importance of the present tense


Communication is a central part to almost any job. Especially if the job involves convincing people. 


A researcher at a university wants to convince bursary organizations that a project is worth funding. A marketer wants to convince consumers that a particular brand product or service is worth buying. A politician wants to convince voters that a set of policies and values are worth supporting. 


Even in everyday conversation, we want to convince our listeners that our viewpoint is worth hearing.


What are some strategies that will get your audience to listen to you? People who study rhetoric will say that persuasion is a subtle art, full of complex rules. Behavioral psychologists will tell you that in order to be convincing, you need to know how people think. 


But if we don’t want to study the deep mysteries of language and mind, we can get people to listen to us with a simple rule. According to a set of studies from 2023, people who speak or write in the present tense sound more certain. Certainty is persuasive (Packard et al, 2023).


In other words, using present tense is sort of a communication “life hack” to instantly boost persuasiveness. This finding raises some questions: 
Why does using the present tense bolster certainty?
Who can benefit most from this life hack? 
How can we use this life hack responsibly? 



H2: Why does the present tense make us sound certain?


Of all the things to affect our perceived sense of certainty, how much of a difference can verb tense make? 

To find out, researchers looked at over 500,000 product reviews on Amazon. The study found that the reviews that used presence tense were graded “helpful” far more often than the views using past tense. Another follow-up experiment in the study found that the “tense effect” applies to word-of-mouth reviews--i.e., conversations between people (Packard et al, 2023). 

What is behind the link between verb tense and helpfulness? 

The present tense makes a statement sound true all the time. “One of verbs’ key roles is telling time,” write the authors. “Saying ‘France was fun’ implies that the content hinges on a particular, potentially idiosyncratic experience … using past tense to express attitudes suggests a degree of subjectivity” (Packard et al, 2023).

In other words, using past tense to make a claim makes that claim conditional. Someone who hears or reads the above claim--”France was fun”-- might wonder, “will France be fun when I go? Is France fun for everyone, all the time?”

On the other hand, the present tense is “generalizable or universal.” Saying that France is fun implies that this statement “is a genuine and active part of current reality” (Packard et al, 2023). The present tense, in other words, suggests that a claim is true under any conditions, and will remain true under any conditions. “Such certainty suggests that an attitude is true not only for the person who holds it but for other people as well” (Packard et al, 2023). 

It  may seem like a small detail of communication, but the present tense has the power to imply unconditional truth. This is a powerful rhetorical ability. 

H3: How present tense can give unheard people a stronger voice


The value of sounding persuasive is obvious for marketers. Saying “this product is what you need” is more effective than saying “this product will be what you need.” There is no uncertainty with the former, while the latter is conditional. 


Sounding convincing is especially important in a time when trust in corporations is low (Petrocelli, 2023). In a 2023 study, researchers find that the world of online personalities, pop-up ads, and influencers creates an environment “in which it is difficult, if not impossible, to assess the credibility of source information” (Petrocelli, 2023). To cut through the chatter, it’s best to use language that leaves little-to-no room for uncertainty: i.e., the present tense. 


However useful this communications “life hack” might be for selling stuff, it might be most beneficial to those groups who need to be heard. 


Decades of research tells us that women are perceived as being less assertive than their male counterparts. This perceived lack of assertiveness poses a barrier to women seeking positions of leadership (Kulkarni & Mishra, 2022). 


Using the present tense to convey ideas, claims, and arguments can help get people to listen. Sounding more certain, and thus more persuasive, could allow women (and any other groups that go unheard) to overcome long standing barriers in the professional world. 


No marginalized group should have to tailor their communication style to match the dominant group. But as we wait for social roles to be dismantled completely, language use is a relatively easy--and very effective--way to change perceptions. 


H2: Can convincing language make positive social change? 


If the above section tells us anything, it’s that language can be used to make positive social change. This is why the use of present tense language could be particularly helpful in activism. 


Trying to convince people that climate change or social injustice are real (and dangerous) usually involves citing facts and statistics. A climate activist might say, “X tons of greenhouse gas are released by the transportation sector every year. Here are ways we could change the transport infrastructure to reduce emissions.”


The activist might be using the less-certain tense because they are citing science, and science avoids making categorical claims. Typically, science reveals “correlations” or “links” between a variable and an observable effect. The lack of “absolute” language in scientific communications is a very real barrier to climate action (Freudenburg & Muselli, 2013).


We know that a climate activist would be more convincing if they say, “changing transportation infrastructure eliminates X tons of greenhouse emissions per year.” Saying “will eliminate” or “could eliminate” merely clouds the urgency of the message.


We can also see the power of present tense in speeches, poetry, and music. The song “We are Winning,” by the hip-hop group Flobots, is a great example of how verb tense affects the potency of a message. The song is about waging a mental war on the forces seeking to keep the masses from taking ownership of our own power. Consider these lyrics:


Roses sprout from empty lots and sidewalk cracks
Pacifist guerrillas move undetected through concrete jungles
New forms are beginning to take shape
Once-occupied minds are activating
People are waking up
The insurgency is alive and well (Flobots, 2007)


The song would not communicate the same meaning if the lyricists had said, “minds will activate,” or “the insurgency will be alive and well.” The song would not land the same way if it were called “We will win.” The repeated present tense makes listeners feel as though positive change is happening right now. It also makes listeners feel like they are part of this change.




H2: When is the right time to sound convincing?


When it comes to making a persuasive point, it’s not really useful to draw attention to the conditional, subjective, or unknown aspects of your argument. 


Issues like climate destruction are pressing. Therefore, it’s important to persuade people that there are real problems, with real solutions. It could be worth it to sacrifice full accuracy for certainty when the stakes are particularly high--and time-sensitive.


However, leaving out the conditional or subjective aspects of a claim is not the same as making up facts to support a claim. 


So, before we take our communications life hack and run with it, we should note that many people who aim to sound convincing are not interested in noble causes like climate activism or social change. Someone who successfully uses strong, present tense verbs could be advancing an agenda based on lies and misinformation. In this way, rhetorical “hacks” can be dangerous.


Certain politicians, for instance, are very good at sounding assured--even when they are completely wrong about the facts. Even if it’s not their intent to lie, many leaders speak “with little to no concern for truth” in their attempt to sound convincing. Applied cognitive psychologists describe these people as “bullsh***ers” (Petrocelli et al, 2023).


H3: The responsibilities of sounding convincing


Using the present tense can help people sound like they know what they’re talking about. But is it okay to use communication strategies that make you sound convincing when you don’t know what you’re talking about--when you’re bullsh***ing? 


It’s possible that presenting a case with the “universal” truth of the present tense incurs a certain amount of responsibility to be factual.


In other words, it’s acceptable to say “zero-emission transportation eliminates huge amounts of greenhouse gas,” even though this claim technically depends on things like which zero-emission technology we use. It’s not acceptable to say, “the climate is perfectly fine.”


If you can back up certainty with fact, in other words, then use whatever rhetorical tools you need to sound certain. It’s okay for businesses, politicians, artists, and activists to bolster their sense of certainty with the present tense--as long as the core premise of their claims is valid.","[{'role': 'User', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Below are two articles I wrote.

The right name can increase consumer engagement, while the wrong name can alienate people. \n\n\nRecent research tells us that the spelling of a brand name also has a large impact on that brand’s image. \n\n\nIn the last few years, the trend of “unconventional” spelling has been on the rise: this tactic was “the top brand naming trend” of 2021 (Costello et al, 2023). In an attempt to make a memorable name, some brands--like the ride sharing company “Lyft”--are intentionally misspelling words.\n\n\nJust how effective is this strategy? Do consumers respond well to unconventionally-spelled brands and products? Yes and no. \n\n\nA recent study finds that unconventional spelling is desirable under certain conditions only. If these conditions are not met, consumers are unlikely to engage with an unconventionally-spelled brand. \n\n\nThe rules of unconventional spelling can also be applied to performing artists, such as musicians. Instead of randomly choosing an alternative spelling for a stage name, artists can use alternative spelling to better create and portray their image.   \n\n\n\n\nH2: What is unconventional spelling--and do consumers like it?\n\n\n“Unconventional” spelling refers to the incorrect spelling of a recognizable word. Unconventional spelling can happen in three ways: \nShortening the conventional spelling (i.e., Lil’ Debbie vs Little Debbie)\nLengthening the conventional spelling (Tripp vs. Trip) \nSubstituting letters of the conventional spelling (Lyft vs. Lift)\n\n\nA lot of brand strategists are telling their clients that unconventional spelling is a good idea (Costello et al, 2023). But is it? \n\n\nOn the positive side, unconventionally spelled names are distinctive, which make them \neasy to trademark\nmemorable\ntrendy\n\n\nAccording to a study done in 2023, however, unconventional spelling is not always seen favorably.\n\n\nIn the first part of the study, roughly 150 participants were given a choice to sample a product from two competing (and fictional) brands. In the follow-up experiment, over 300 participants shared their reactions to existing brand names--some of which were altered to use unconventional spelling. Participants in both experiments reacted more favorably to the conventionally-spelled names (Costello et al, 2023). \n\n\nWhy is this the case? According to the researchers, “consumers perceive the choice of an unconventionally spelled name as an overt persuasion attempt by the marketer, and thus view the brand as less sincere” (Costello et al, 2023). In other words, people can tell when a brand uses unconventional spelling as a gimmick to get attention. And people don’t like it. \n\n\nH3: What are “good reasons” for choosing unconventional spelling?\n\n\nBecause “sincerity is one of the largest drivers of brand support” (Costello et al, 2023), brand strategists should make sure they have a valid reason for choosing an unconventional spelling. \n\n\nTheorists in the past have argued that unconventional spelling is a kind of rule-breaking, which consumers might see as “cool.” But the 2023 study finds that this attempt is easy to see through: consumers believe that cool brands don’t try to be cool (Costello et al, 2023).\n\n\nIn part of the experiment, participants were asked to share their feelings on the name of a made-up fitness app. Half of the 300 participants were told the app was called “Daily Gainz,” and the other half was told the app was called “Daily Gains.” Participants told researchers that the unconventionally-spelled version was “trying too hard” to be “cool and hip” (Costello et al, 2023). \n\n\nIf the motive behind alternative spelling seems sincere, however, then consumers will look at this spelling more favorably. Researchers found (Costello et al, 2023) that consumers don’t mind unconventionally-spelled brands if:\nthe name was crowdsourced by people, rather than chosen by the company\nthe spelling is related to the brand’s history\nthe spelling was altered as a result of a trademark dispute\n\n\nThese are very specific scenarios. And surprisingly, none of them concern the relationship between the spelling of a brand and the product or service offered. This begs the question: if an alternative spelling is relevant enough, or meaningful enough, will audiences respond well? If the unconventional spelling “makes sense” with a brand, will people be more willing to support this brand?\n\n\nH3: Why unconventional spelling should tell consumers something about the brand \n\n\nIt’s possible that unconventionally-spelled names seem more sincere if the uniqueness of the spelling actually refers to the uniqueness of the brand. In other words, it might be better if unconventionally-spelled names for brands were associated with unique qualities of the brand. \n\n\nResearch has shown that wordplay in slogans can foster the image, or personality, of the brand behind the slogan (Miller & Toman, 2016). Misspelling brand names in order to tell consumers something about the brand could count as wordplay. So, if these findings apply to brand names as well as slogans, then a clever or meaningful case of unconventional spelling can help create brand image.  \n\n\nConsider the Canadian licensed cannabis producer “SunLeaf Farmacy.” The company substitutes letters to change “Pharmacy” to “Farmacy,” a difference that refers to the fact that the product is both “farmed” and “pharmaceutical.” \n\n\nIn the above example, the reason for the wordplay is obvious (unlike “Lyft”). We know that consumers think unconventional spelling is sincere as long as there’s a good reason for it. So, consumers may look at SunLeaf Farmacy favorably because its unconventional spelling is directly related to the nature of the product.\n\n\nThe high exposure to advertising in everyday culture has led consumers to be incredibly skeptical of marketing tactics (Petrocelli et al, 2023). To many of these consumers, misspelling words for the goal of appearing trendy is little more than lying. Establishing a clear link between a brand’s spelling and a brand’s product is a simple way for a company to come across as sincere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nH2: How performers can use unconventional spelling to build image\n\n\nThe science of unconventional spelling doesn’t just apply to brand names. Just like a business, a performing artist needs a stage name that is both memorable and sincere.\n\n\nA piece featured in the music magazine NME argues that artists re-invent their names to cultivate a persona, or narrative, that matches their musical style or personal values. Robert Zimmerman, according to the author, changed his name to Bob Dylan to project the image of a “train-hopping troubadour.” David Bowie adopted several stage personalities, all with different names, before he felt “able to become a rockstar” (Perry, 2015). \n\n\nBut how can an artist know what stage name will convey the desired persona? Building on what we know about brand names, it’s possible that spelling has a lot to do with how effectively an artist can cultivate their persona. \n\n\nJust like brands, musicians can spell their stage name in a way that refers to a unique, memorable aspect of their performance. \n\n\nThe artist P!nk, for example, substitutes the letter “i” for an exclamation mark. The exclamation mark not only resembles an inverted “i,” but also refers to the rebellious, louder-than-life attitude presented by the artist. \n\n\nThe band Sixx:AM adds an “x” to the word “six” as a nod to the frontman, Nikki Sixx. Fans of the ex-Mötley Crüe member are promised the Nikki Sixx experience by the virtue of Sixx:AM’s name. \n\n\nThe Beatles misspelled “Beetles” as a simple way to include the word “beat” in their band name. As one of the first four-piece rock bands to fill stadiums with dancing fans, the significance of the word “beat” is clear. \n\n\nIf consumers expect a valid reason for businesses to spell a brand name unconventionally, then music fans might expect the same from the artists they follow. Audiences, therefore, could be more likely to follow performers whose names (and the spelling of those names) have a relevant connection to their act or image. \n\n\n\n\nH3: How to make unconventional spelling memorable and sincere\n\n\nBrands and performers--and any other organizations that want followers--can benefit from choosing names that are memorable. And we know that unconventional spelling can make a name memorable. \n\n\nBut we also know that consumers expect a sincere reason for unconventional spelling, beyond being memorable. \n\n\nA way to make unconventional spelling memorable and sincere is to have this spelling refer to a meaningful aspect of the organization in question. This “meaningful aspect” could involve the organization’s history--or it could involve the organization\'s product, services, or performance. \n\n\nIn other words, creative spellings can make a lasting impression, and at the same time, tell consumers what a brand, band, or solo act is “all about.”\n\n\nArticle 2:\n\nH1: How to present your case with certainty: the importance of the present tense\n\n\nCommunication is a central part to almost any job. Especially if the job involves convincing people. \n\n\nA researcher at a university wants to convince bursary organizations that a project is worth funding. A marketer wants to convince consumers that a particular brand product or service is worth buying. A politician wants to convince voters that a set of policies and values are worth supporting. \n\n\nEven in everyday conversation, we want to convince our listeners that our viewpoint is worth hearing.\n\n\nWhat are some strategies that will get your audience to listen to you?

Article 1:

H1: The science of choosing a name


In the world of business, choosing names is important. The right name can increase consumer engagement, while the wrong name can alienate people. 


Recent research tells us that the spelling of a brand name also has a large impact on that brand’s image. 


In the last few years, the trend of “unconventional” spelling has been on the rise: this tactic was “the top brand naming trend” of 2021 (Costello et al, 2023). In an attempt to make a memorable name, some brands--like the ride sharing company “Lyft”--are intentionally misspelling words.


Just how effective is this strategy? Do consumers respond well to unconventionally-spelled brands and products? Yes and no. 


A recent study finds that unconventional spelling is desirable under certain conditions only. If these conditions are not met, consumers are unlikely to engage with an unconventionally-spelled brand. 


The rules of unconventional spelling can also be applied to performing artists, such as musicians. Instead of randomly choosing an alternative spelling for a stage name, artists can use alternative spelling to better create and portray their image.   




H2: What is unconventional spelling--and do consumers like it?


“Unconventional” spelling refers to the incorrect spelling of a recognizable word. Unconventional spelling can happen in three ways: 
Shortening the conventional spelling (i.e., Lil’ Debbie vs Little Debbie)
Lengthening the conventional spelling (Tripp vs. Trip) 
Substituting letters of the conventional spelling (Lyft vs. Lift)


A lot of brand strategists are telling their clients that unconventional spelling is a good idea (Costello et al, 2023). But is it? 


On the positive side, unconventionally spelled names are distinctive, which make them 
easy to trademark
memorable
trendy


According to a study done in 2023, however, unconventional spelling is not always seen favorably.


In the first part of the study, roughly 150 participants were given a choice to sample a product from two competing (and fictional) brands. In the follow-up experiment, over 300 participants shared their reactions to existing brand names--some of which were altered to use unconventional spelling. Participants in both experiments reacted more favorably to the conventionally-spelled names (Costello et al, 2023). 


Why is this the case? According to the researchers, “consumers perceive the choice of an unconventionally spelled name as an overt persuasion attempt by the marketer, and thus view the brand as less sincere” (Costello et al, 2023). In other words, people can tell when a brand uses unconventional spelling as a gimmick to get attention. And people don’t like it. 


H3: What are “good reasons” for choosing unconventional spelling?


Because “sincerity is one of the largest drivers of brand support” (Costello et al, 2023), brand strategists should make sure they have a valid reason for choosing an unconventional spelling. 


Theorists in the past have argued that unconventional spelling is a kind of rule-breaking, which consumers might see as “cool.” But the 2023 study finds that this attempt is easy to see through: consumers believe that cool brands don’t try to be cool (Costello et al, 2023).


In part of the experiment, participants were asked to share their feelings on the name of a made-up fitness app. Half of the 300 participants were told the app was called “Daily Gainz,” and the other half was told the app was called “Daily Gains.” Participants told researchers that the unconventionally-spelled version was “trying too hard” to be “cool and hip” (Costello et al, 2023). 


If the motive behind alternative spelling seems sincere, however, then consumers will look at this spelling more favorably. Researchers found (Costello et al, 2023) that consumers don’t mind unconventionally-spelled brands if:
the name was crowdsourced by people, rather than chosen by the company
the spelling is related to the brand’s history
the spelling was altered as a result of a trademark dispute


These are very specific scenarios. And surprisingly, none of them concern the relationship between the spelling of a brand and the product or service offered. This begs the question: if an alternative spelling is relevant enough, or meaningful enough, will audiences respond well? If the unconventional spelling “makes sense” with a brand, will people be more willing to support this brand?


H3: Why unconventional spelling should tell consumers something about the brand 


It’s possible that unconventionally-spelled names seem more sincere if the uniqueness of the spelling actually refers to the uniqueness of the brand. In other words, it might be better if unconventionally-spelled names for brands were associated with unique qualities of the brand. 


Research has shown that wordplay in slogans can foster the image, or personality, of the brand behind the slogan (Miller & Toman, 2016). Misspelling brand names in order to tell consumers something about the brand could count as wordplay. So, if these findings apply to brand names as well as slogans, then a clever or meaningful case of unconventional spelling can help create brand image.  


Consider the Canadian licensed cannabis producer “SunLeaf Farmacy.” The company substitutes letters to change “Pharmacy” to “Farmacy,” a difference that refers to the fact that the product is both “farmed” and “pharmaceutical.” 


In the above example, the reason for the wordplay is obvious (unlike “Lyft”). We know that consumers think unconventional spelling is sincere as long as there’s a good reason for it. So, consumers may look at SunLeaf Farmacy favorably because its unconventional spelling is directly related to the nature of the product.


The high exposure to advertising in everyday culture has led consumers to be incredibly skeptical of marketing tactics (Petrocelli et al, 2023). To many of these consumers, misspelling words for the goal of appearing trendy is little more than lying. Establishing a clear link between a brand’s spelling and a brand’s product is a simple way for a company to come across as sincere.

H2: How performers can use unconventional spelling to build image


The science of unconventional spelling doesn’t just apply to brand names. Just like a business, a performing artist needs a stage name that is both memorable and sincere.


A piece featured in the music magazine NME argues that artists re-invent their names to cultivate a persona, or narrative, that matches their musical style or personal values. Robert Zimmerman, according to the author, changed his name to Bob Dylan to project the image of a “train-hopping troubadour.” David Bowie adopted several stage personalities, all with different names, before he felt “able to become a rockstar” (Perry, 2015). 


But how can an artist know what stage name will convey the desired persona? Building on what we know about brand names, it’s possible that spelling has a lot to do with how effectively an artist can cultivate their persona. 


Just like brands, musicians can spell their stage name in a way that refers to a unique, memorable aspect of their performance. 


The artist P!nk, for example, substitutes the letter “i” for an exclamation mark. The exclamation mark not only resembles an inverted “i,” but also refers to the rebellious, louder-than-life attitude presented by the artist. 


The band Sixx:AM adds an “x” to the word “six” as a nod to the frontman, Nikki Sixx. Fans of the ex-Mötley Crüe member are promised the Nikki Sixx experience by the virtue of Sixx:AM’s name. 


The Beatles misspelled “Beetles” as a simple way to include the word “beat” in their band name. As one of the first four-piece rock bands to fill stadiums with dancing fans, the significance of the word “beat” is clear. 


If consumers expect a valid reason for businesses to spell a brand name unconventionally, then music fans might expect the same from the artists they follow. Audiences, therefore, could be more likely to follow performers whose names (and the spelling of those names) have a relevant connection to their act or image. 




H3: How to make unconventional spelling memorable and sincere


Brands and performers--and any other organizations that want followers--can benefit from choosing names that are memorable. And we know that unconventional spelling can make a name memorable. 


But we also know that consumers expect a sincere reason for unconventional spelling, beyond being memorable. 


A way to make unconventional spelling memorable and sincere is to have this spelling refer to a meaningful aspect of the organization in question. This “meaningful aspect” could involve the organization’s history--or it could involve the organization's product, services, or performance. 


In other words, creative spellings can make a lasting impression, and at the same time, tell consumers what a brand, band, or solo act is “all about.”

H1: How to present your case with certainty: the importance of the present tense


Communication is a central part to almost any job. Especially if the job involves convincing people. 


A researcher at a university wants to convince bursary organizations that a project is worth funding. A marketer wants to convince consumers that a particular brand product or service is worth buying. A politician wants to convince voters that a set of policies and values are worth supporting. 


Even in everyday conversation, we want to convince our listeners that our viewpoint is worth hearing.


What are some strategies that will get your audience to listen to you? People who study rhetoric will say that persuasion is a subtle art, full of complex rules. Behavioral psychologists will tell you that in order to be convincing, you need to know how people think. 


But if we don’t want to study the deep mysteries of language and mind, we can get people to listen to us with a simple rule. According to a set of studies from 2023, people who speak or write in the present tense sound more certain. Certainty is persuasive (Packard et al, 2023).


In other words, using present tense is sort of a communication “life hack” to instantly boost persuasiveness. This finding raises some questions: 
Why does using the present tense bolster certainty?
Who can benefit most from this life hack? 
How can we use this life hack responsibly? 



H2: Why does the present tense make us sound certain?


Of all the things to affect our perceived sense of certainty, how much of a difference can verb tense make? 

To find out, researchers looked at over 500,000 product reviews on Amazon. The study found that the reviews that used presence tense were graded “helpful” far more often than the views using past tense. Another follow-up experiment in the study found that the “tense effect” applies to word-of-mouth reviews--i.e., conversations between people (Packard et al, 2023). 

What is behind the link between verb tense and helpfulness? 

The present tense makes a statement sound true all the time. “One of verbs’ key roles is telling time,” write the authors. “Saying ‘France was fun’ implies that the content hinges on a particular, potentially idiosyncratic experience … using past tense to express attitudes suggests a degree of subjectivity” (Packard et al, 2023).

In other words, using past tense to make a claim makes that claim conditional. Someone who hears or reads the above claim--”France was fun”-- might wonder, “will France be fun when I go? Is France fun for everyone, all the time?”

On the other hand, the present tense is “generalizable or universal.” Saying that France is fun implies that this statement “is a genuine and active part of current reality” (Packard et al, 2023). The present tense, in other words, suggests that a claim is true under any conditions, and will remain true under any conditions. “Such certainty suggests that an attitude is true not only for the person who holds it but for other people as well” (Packard et al, 2023). 

It  may seem like a small detail of communication, but the present tense has the power to imply unconditional truth. This is a powerful rhetorical ability. 

H3: How present tense can give unheard people a stronger voice


The value of sounding persuasive is obvious for marketers. Saying “this product is what you need” is more effective than saying “this product will be what you need.” There is no uncertainty with the former, while the latter is conditional. 


Sounding convincing is especially important in a time when trust in corporations is low (Petrocelli, 2023). In a 2023 study, researchers find that the world of online personalities, pop-up ads, and influencers creates an environment “in which it is difficult, if not impossible, to assess the credibility of source information” (Petrocelli, 2023). To cut through the chatter, it’s best to use language that leaves little-to-no room for uncertainty: i.e., the present tense. 


However useful this communications “life hack” might be for selling stuff, it might be most beneficial to those groups who need to be heard. 


Decades of research tells us that women are perceived as being less assertive than their male counterparts. This perceived lack of assertiveness poses a barrier to women seeking positions of leadership (Kulkarni & Mishra, 2022). 


Using the present tense to convey ideas, claims, and arguments can help get people to listen. Sounding more certain, and thus more persuasive, could allow women (and any other groups that go unheard) to overcome long standing barriers in the professional world. 


No marginalized group should have to tailor their communication style to match the dominant group. But as we wait for social roles to be dismantled completely, language use is a relatively easy--and very effective--way to change perceptions. 


H2: Can convincing language make positive social change? 


If the above section tells us anything, it’s that language can be used to make positive social change. This is why the use of present tense language could be particularly helpful in activism. 


Trying to convince people that climate change or social injustice are real (and dangerous) usually involves citing facts and statistics. A climate activist might say, “X tons of greenhouse gas are released by the transportation sector every year. Here are ways we could change the transport infrastructure to reduce emissions.”


The activist might be using the less-certain tense because they are citing science, and science avoids making categorical claims. Typically, science reveals “correlations” or “links” between a variable and an observable effect. The lack of “absolute” language in scientific communications is a very real barrier to climate action (Freudenburg & Muselli, 2013).


We know that a climate activist would be more convincing if they say, “changing transportation infrastructure eliminates X tons of greenhouse emissions per year.” Saying “will eliminate” or “could eliminate” merely clouds the urgency of the message.


We can also see the power of present tense in speeches, poetry, and music. The song “We are Winning,” by the hip-hop group Flobots, is a great example of how verb tense affects the potency of a message. The song is about waging a mental war on the forces seeking to keep the masses from taking ownership of our own power. Consider these lyrics:


Roses sprout from empty lots and sidewalk cracks
Pacifist guerrillas move undetected through concrete jungles
New forms are beginning to take shape
Once-occupied minds are activating
People are waking up
The insurgency is alive and well (Flobots, 2007)


The song would not communicate the same meaning if the lyricists had said, “minds will activate,” or “the insurgency will be alive and well.” The song would not land the same way if it were called “We will win.” The repeated present tense makes listeners feel as though positive change is happening right now. It also makes listeners feel like they are part of this change.




H2: When is the right time to sound convincing?


When it comes to making a persuasive point, it’s not really useful to draw attention to the conditional, subjective, or unknown aspects of your argument. 


Issues like climate destruction are pressing. Therefore, it’s important to persuade people that there are real problems, with real solutions. It could be worth it to sacrifice full accuracy for certainty when the stakes are particularly high--and time-sensitive.


However, leaving out the conditional or subjective aspects of a claim is not the same as making up facts to support a claim. 


So, before we take our communications life hack and run with it, we should note that many people who aim to sound convincing are not interested in noble causes like climate activism or social change. Someone who successfully uses strong, present tense verbs could be advancing an agenda based on lies and misinformation. In this way, rhetorical “hacks” can be dangerous.


Certain politicians, for instance, are very good at sounding assured--even when they are completely wrong about the facts. Even if it’s not their intent to lie, many leaders speak “with little to no concern for truth” in their attempt to sound convincing. Applied cognitive psychologists describe these people as “bullsh***ers” (Petrocelli et al, 2023).


H3: The responsibilities of sounding convincing


Using the present tense can help people sound like they know what they’re talking about. But is it okay to use communication strategies that make you sound convincing when you don’t know what you’re talking about--when you’re bullsh***ing? 


It’s possible that presenting a case with the “universal” truth of the present tense incurs a certain amount of responsibility to be factual.


In other words, it’s acceptable to say “zero-emission transportation eliminates huge amounts of greenhouse gas,” even though this claim technically depends on things like which zero-emission technology we use. It’s not acceptable to say, “the climate is perfectly fine.”


If you can back up certainty with fact, in other words, then use whatever rhetorical tools you need to sound certain. It’s okay for businesses, politicians, artists, and activists to bolster their sense of certainty with the present tense--as long as the core premise of their claims is valid.

The right name can increase consumer engagement, while the wrong name can alienate people. \n\n\nRecent research tells us that the spelling of a brand name also has a large impact on that brand’s image. \n\n\nIn the last few years, the trend of “unconventional” spelling has been on the rise: this tactic was “the top brand naming trend” of 2021 (Costello et al, 2023). In an attempt to make a memorable name, some brands--like the ride sharing company “Lyft”--are intentionally misspelling words.\n\n\nJust how effective is this strategy? Do consumers respond well to unconventionally-spelled brands and products? Yes and no. \n\n\nA recent study finds that unconventional spelling is desirable under certain conditions only. If these conditions are not met, consumers are unlikely to engage with an unconventionally-spelled brand. \n\n\nThe rules of unconventional spelling can also be applied to performing artists, such as musicians. Instead of randomly choosing an alternative spelling for a stage name, artists can use alternative spelling to better create and portray their image.   \n\n\n\n\nH2: What is unconventional spelling--and do consumers like it?\n\n\n“Unconventional” spelling refers to the incorrect spelling of a recognizable word. Unconventional spelling can happen in three ways: \nShortening the conventional spelling (i.e., Lil’ Debbie vs Little Debbie)\nLengthening the conventional spelling (Tripp vs. Trip) \nSubstituting letters of the conventional spelling (Lyft vs. Lift)\n\n\nA lot of brand strategists are telling their clients that unconventional spelling is a good idea (Costello et al, 2023). But is it? \n\n\nOn the positive side, unconventionally spelled names are distinctive, which make them \neasy to trademark\nmemorable\ntrendy\n\n\nAccording to a study done in 2023, however, unconventional spelling is not always seen favorably.\n\n\nIn the first part of the study, roughly 150 participants were given a choice to sample a product from two competing (and fictional) brands. In the follow-up experiment, over 300 participants shared their reactions to existing brand names--some of which were altered to use unconventional spelling. Participants in both experiments reacted more favorably to the conventionally-spelled names (Costello et al, 2023). \n\n\nWhy is this the case? According to the researchers, “consumers perceive the choice of an unconventionally spelled name as an overt persuasion attempt by the marketer, and thus view the brand as less sincere” (Costello et al, 2023). In other words, people can tell when a brand uses unconventional spelling as a gimmick to get attention. And people don’t like it. \n\n\nH3: What are “good reasons” for choosing unconventional spelling?\n\n\nBecause “sincerity is one of the largest drivers of brand support” (Costello et al, 2023), brand strategists should make sure they have a valid reason for choosing an unconventional spelling. \n\n\nTheorists in the past have argued that unconventional spelling is a kind of rule-breaking, which consumers might see as “cool.” But the 2023 study finds that this attempt is easy to see through: consumers believe that cool brands don’t try to be cool (Costello et al, 2023).\n\n\nIn part of the experiment, participants were asked to share their feelings on the name of a made-up fitness app. Half of the 300 participants were told the app was called “Daily Gainz,” and the other half was told the app was called “Daily Gains.” Participants told researchers that the unconventionally-spelled version was “trying too hard” to be “cool and hip” (Costello et al, 2023). \n\n\nIf the motive behind alternative spelling seems sincere, however, then consumers will look at this spelling more favorably.

H1: How to improve indoor wayfinding in healthcare: designing visual cues for all ages and abilities

Hospitals and healthcare centers are so large and complicated that some experts compare them to “small indoor cities” (Jia et al., 2023). This complexity leads to difficulties in indoor wayfinding--which cause some of the most common problems (Jia et al, 2023) in healthcare. 

People getting lost in hospitals results in:
overcrowding
long patient waiting time
long patient/nurse traveling distance 

So, how can we fix these problems? 

It depends on our “spatial cognition style.” For some people, a map is all that’s needed. But the majority of us can’t recall and conjure a detailed map in our minds. Most of us rely on cues from our environment. So, if you prefer to search for signs or landmarks, you are not alone.

So, which visual cues are best for reducing spatial anxiety? 

In hospitals, we will encounter signs and arrows that guide us to various departments. First-time visitors to a complex location rely heavily on these visual cues (Yu et al, 2023). However, research also shows signage alone is “not sufficient to guide wayfinding” (Asli et al, 2023). 

That’s why the science of color coding is emerging as a new field of study. The merit of color coding is proved: many hospitals already use colored stripes that run along the floors and walls. But it’s only now that we’re examining if people respond differently to these kinds of color coding.

H2: Color-coded stripes: where to put them, and what colors to choose?

As surprising as it sounds, the location of color-coded stripes, and the colors themselves, make a big difference. 

When surveyed, a group of 375 hospital patients told researchers whether they liked color coding that’s placed on the middle of the walls, the bottom of the walls, or the middle of the floor. The group also indicated whether they preferred warm colors, cool colors, or mixed colors.

The study finds that the preferred style of color coding changes with age (Asli et al., 2023). 
Young adults prefer visual cues with mixed colors, on the middle of the floor. 
Early middle-aged adults like warm-colored stripes running through the middle of the wall (at eye-level).
Late middle-aged adults prefer warm colors, but at the bottom of the wall.

The study also found that there are certain features that make visual cues appealing for all age groups:
All respondents preferred navigational stripes that contrast with their background, or “have a clear shape or other special feature” (Alsi et al, 2023) 
Visual cues receive the most notice when they are placed at or below eye-level 

We can make all color-coded stripes contrast with their background, and avoid placing them too high. But we can’t put colorful stripes on every surface below eye-level, and we can’t use every color in the rainbow. 

So, we have to choose carefully. The survey finds that “arbitrary and excessively abundant” visual cues increase anxiety. “Coherent and purposeful” color schemes, on the other hand, make a significant, positive impact on wayfinding (Asli et al., 2023)

But how do we decide where to put the color coding, and what palette to use? 

What hospitals really need is a personalized set of color coding for every patient. The good news is, this is possible through technology. 

Augmented reality displays can highlight just one path to a destination while showing relevant, individually-tailored cues to assist along the way. 

H2: How far can we take wayfinding technology--so it can take us even farther?

Using your smartphone’s camera, wayfinding apps can superimpose visual cues onto the hospital environment. Imagine Pokemon Go: but instead of adding a virtual Pikachu to the hallway you’re in, wayfinding apps add navigational aids like arrows. 

Ideally, each user would have a custom-made display that’s suited to their age and wayfinding preferences.

A late-middle-age patient using one of these apps might see an orange path, placed at the bottom of the walls. If this patient prefers to use landmarks, their display could highlight specific environmental elements--such as paintings or windows--as waypoints. These waypoints would confirm that we are on the right track, and indicate how close or far we are to our destination.

In addition to providing this kind of information, virtual reality-style wayfinding apps can include distance information as part of their display. Among the 375 hospital patients that were surveyed in 2023, distance estimation was the weakest wayfinding skill for adults of all ages (Asli et al. 2023). 

So, there would be immense benefit in having a virtual display that could clearly display the distance between waypoints. In this way, the distance would adjust, in real time, as users went closer or farther from each waypoint. 

H3: Why visual cues benefit the entire healthcare system

Without effective visual cues, many individuals will follow crowds, spend more time looking for directions, and suffer from spatial anxiety (Dang et al., 2023). 

This goes for healthcare professionals as well as patients. According to one study, over 67% of hospital employees “are unable to perform their jobs efficiently due to inappropriate layouts of the working environment.” In some hospitals, nurses spend more time walking between locations than they spend on caregiving activities (Jia et al., 2023). 

For healthcare workers, getting around quickly can be the key to saving a life.

For patients, going to the hospital is rarely a positive experience. Even when you’re showing up for a planned appointment, you are in a rush to find the right place on time.

So, the last thing a medical patient or professional wants is additional anxiety on an already-anxious mind.

H3: How insights from psychological research can guide wayfinding technology 

Peer-reviewed psychological research (Asli et al., 2023) proves that color coding in complex environments 
diminishes route complexity
assures visitors that they are on the right way 
reduces stress
prevents missed or late arrival for appointments

We might take it for granted that all color coding works the same. But the main takeaway from this study is that little differences, like color scheme and placement, make a big difference. 

The future of wayfinding aids, therefore, is customization.  

We need to understand how individual patients react to different visual cues. This will help us understand how technology can make a more efficient wayfinding experience for healthcare patients and professionals alike.

New insights will be revealed as researchers conduct more studies. We now know that age is a factor that affects our preference for visual cues. But what about factors like biological sex, occupation, and neurodivergent conditions (such as autism or ADHD)? 

As these kinds of insights are revealed, we will be able to design more inclusive wayfinding aids, with more people’s specific needs in mind. The goal is to make a safe and convenient healthcare experience for as many people as possible.

H1: How spatial cognition style effects wayfinding in a crisis: Insights from VR studies

Some people just seem to have a knack for finding their way through complicated buildings. Why is wayfinding easy for some and challenging for others? 

According to scientists, it comes down to how we visualize space. Generally speaking, there are three “spatial cognition styles” that determine how we navigate (Dang et al, 2023). 
Landmark style: this is where we look for familiar elements in our environment, and navigate between them by line of sight.
Route style: This is where we memorize a series of directions--i.e., a sequence of left/right turns.
Survey style: this is where we follow a mental, bird’s eye map of our environment. These wayfinders know where they are in relation to landmarks, intersections, and their destination. 

Survey style cognition leads to the best wayfinding skills (Dang et al, 2023). But not everybody has this cognition style--which presents a problem for public safety and convenience. 

How quickly would landmark and route style thinkers find their way, for example, when evacuating a complex building (like a hospital) in an emergency?

H2: How VR technology tests our wayfinding ability?

To keep people safe, it would be useful to test how people with different cognitive styles navigate under pressure. But scientists can’t place test subjects in a truly dangerous scenario. Luckily, there’s virtual reality (VR) technology that can recreate the experience of an emergency with none of the danger. 

With mobile VR, research participants move through real space during a simulated crisis. This allows experimenters to better simulate a real-life fire scenario. Plus, VR has other advantages, such as:
environmental variables can be controlled easily 
participants are psychologically immersed in the experience
the experiment can be carried out as many times as needed, in nearly any location

Two separate VR wayfinding studies were conducted in 2023, using this kind of technology. These studies reveal insights on:
how different people navigate in an emergency 
what wayfinding aids they are able to focus on
how these aids can be improved

H2: What do VR studies tell us about how people navigate?

One of the VR studies from 2023 (Dang et al., 2023) grouped people according to their spatial cognition styles. Participants were asked to navigate out of a building fire taking place in a VR. The VR building was based on a scan of an existing structure, and the VR system used cutting-edge technology that allowed participants to cover real ground as they moved. 

This study, along with a second, similar study, employed sophisticated eye-tracking technology that provides accurate data on where participants focus, and for how long.

So, what did the studies find?

First of all, an emergency scenario forces us to navigate under pressure. We have to make decisions as quickly as possible. This “time pressure” affects everyone’s wayfinding ability, no matter what cognitive style we have (Yu et al., 2023). But some people are able to cope more effectively than others. 

People with a survey-style of navigation were able to find their way out of a virtual building faster than those inclined toward route or landmark style. Unfortunately, survey-style navigation is by no means the most common kind. 

This means that the majority of us will default to landmark or route-styles when we try to get through a complicated building. So, we’ll probably spend too much time re-planning routes, or, in some cases, following crowds. That’s not speculation: the VR simulations were populated with “non-player characters” (NPCs) that frequently misled test subjects. 

Interestingly, the NPCs were not programmed to mislead the test subjects intentionally. The experimenters were unsure how navigation style would affect peoples’ dependence on crowds. 
It was a surprising (yet very telling) result that, in each VR scenario, people without a clear evacuation plan were more likely to follow the herd (Dang et al, 2023; Yu et al., 2023). 

Re-planning and being misled are highly annoying at any time, and particularly bad in an emergency. So, what can we do to help all those non-survey-style navigators out there? 

H3: How do we make wayfinding easier for everyone? Designing effective visual cues

Complicated buildings--healthcare centers, universities, office towers--need to make wayfinding easier for everyone. One way to do this is to make navigation aids that appeal to the majority of us who rely on visual cues in our environment. 

One of the two VR wayfinding studies from 2023 suggests that signage isn’t always enough. “People with a route or landmark style rely more on evacuation signs… to find their way,” the researchers say, but “are more likely to lose their way in an emergency” (Dang et al., 2023).

In contrast, the other VR study from 2023 found that signs can be a very useful form of visual cue. The key might lie in how these signs are designed. 

Unsurprisingly, the signs that got the most attention were large and bright. But the study has a few extra tips for us. The most effective signs are also: 
dynamic (i.e., a moving display)
placed at the beginning and end of a route
The study also finds that large, straight arrows are a highly effective form of signage (Yu et al. 2023).

The more time participants spent looking at well-designed and well-placed signs, the more likely they were to find the closest exit (Yu et al, 2023).

H2: How can we use augmented reality to make better visual cues?

The nice thing about visual cues (like signs) is that they don’t actually have to be part of the “real” environment. Since we’re talking about VR already, it’s worth mentioning that we have ways of navigating real spaces through “augmented reality.” 

Through our smartphone cameras, wayfinding apps can add virtual elements--bright/dynamic signs, arrows, colored path markers, etc.--to our real environment. 

We know that non-survey thinkers need visual cues to navigate. When it comes to providing these cues, we have options. Visual cues can be added to a building’s interior in real life, or virtually, through technology. 

We probably want the “real” visual cues in an emergency evacuation: it would be impractical to rely on an app to escape a fire. 

But emergency evacuations aren’t the only time-sensitive scenarios. 

In healthcare, it seems like everything is time-sensitive and high-pressure. When we want to save time, effort, and stress (rather than our lives), wayfinding apps can provide all the visual cues we need. 

H3: Why optimizing wayfinding aids is necessary in healthcare

Optimizing wayfinding aids is about convenience as much as safety. 

When we’re in a healthcare building, we are among hundreds of people trying to find destinations on time. The stakes are high: we are trying to make appointments and surgeries that are critical to our health. 

The complexity of the buildings, combined with the risk of being late and missing an important appointment, raises the pressure of wayfinding. And we know that increased pressure can lead to more spatial anxiety.

VR technology has revealed the challenges we face when wayfinding indoors. It seems fitting, then, that VR technology can be the key to overcoming some of these challenges. 

Augmented reality--once the stuff of science fiction--might become a standard part of the healthcare experience. 

But at the end of the day, any navigational aids that reduce spatial anxiety are a welcome addition to hospitals. Whether we use digital or analgog tools, easy wayfinding makes for a safer, convenient healthcare experience.","[{'role': 'User', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Use Palestinian Arabic.

H1: How to improve indoor wayfinding in healthcare: designing visual cues for all ages and abilities

Hospitals and healthcare centers are so large and complicated that some experts compare them to “small indoor cities” (Jia et al., 2023). This complexity leads to difficulties in indoor wayfinding--which cause some of the most common problems (Jia et al, 2023) in healthcare. 

People getting lost in hospitals results in:
overcrowding
long patient waiting time
long patient/nurse traveling distance 

So, how can we fix these problems? 

It depends on our “spatial cognition style.” For some people, a map is all that’s needed. But the majority of us can’t recall and conjure a detailed map in our minds. Most of us rely on cues from our environment. So, if you prefer to search for signs or landmarks, you are not alone.

So, which visual cues are best for reducing spatial anxiety? 

In hospitals, we will encounter signs and arrows that guide us to various departments. First-time visitors to a complex location rely heavily on these visual cues (Yu et al, 2023). However, research also shows signage alone is “not sufficient to guide wayfinding” (Asli et al, 2023). 

That’s why the science of color coding is emerging as a new field of study. The merit of color coding is proved: many hospitals already use colored stripes that run along the floors and walls. But it’s only now that we’re examining if people respond differently to these kinds of color coding.

H2: Color-coded stripes: where to put them, and what colors to choose?

As surprising as it sounds, the location of color-coded stripes, and the colors themselves, make a big difference. 

When surveyed, a group of 375 hospital patients told researchers whether they liked color coding that’s placed on the middle of the walls, the bottom of the walls, or the middle of the floor. The group also indicated whether they preferred warm colors, cool colors, or mixed colors.

The study finds that the preferred style of color coding changes with age (Asli et al., 2023). 
Young adults prefer visual cues with mixed colors, on the middle of the floor. 
Early middle-aged adults like warm-colored stripes running through the middle of the wall (at eye-level).
Late middle-aged adults prefer warm colors, but at the bottom of the wall.

The study also found that there are certain features that make visual cues appealing for all age groups:
All respondents preferred navigational stripes that contrast with their background, or “have a clear shape or other special feature” (Alsi et al, 2023) 
Visual cues receive the most notice when they are placed at or below eye-level 

We can make all color-coded stripes contrast with their background, and avoid placing them too high. But we can’t put colorful stripes on every surface below eye-level, and we can’t use every color in the rainbow. 

So, we have to choose carefully. The survey finds that “arbitrary and excessively abundant” visual cues increase anxiety. “Coherent and purposeful” color schemes, on the other hand, make a significant, positive impact on wayfinding (Asli et al., 2023)

But how do we decide where to put the color coding, and what palette to use? 

What hospitals really need is a personalized set of color coding for every patient. The good news is, this is possible through technology. 

Augmented reality displays can highlight just one path to a destination while showing relevant, individually-tailored cues to assist along the way. 

H2: How far can we take wayfinding technology--so it can take us even farther?

Using your smartphone’s camera, wayfinding apps can superimpose visual cues onto the hospital environment. Imagine Pokemon Go: but instead of adding a virtual Pikachu to the hallway you’re in, wayfinding apps add navigational aids like arrows. 

Ideally, each user would have a custom-made display that’s suited to their age and wayfinding preferences.

A late-middle-age patient using one of these apps might see an orange path, placed at the bottom of the walls. If this patient prefers to use landmarks, their display could highlight specific environmental elements--such as paintings or windows--as waypoints. These waypoints would confirm that we are on the right track, and indicate how close or far we are to our destination.

In addition to providing this kind of information, virtual reality-style wayfinding apps can include distance information as part of their display. Among the 375 hospital patients that were surveyed in 2023, distance estimation was the weakest wayfinding skill for adults of all ages (Asli et al. 2023). 

So, there would be immense benefit in having a virtual display that could clearly display the distance between waypoints. In this way, the distance would adjust, in real time, as users went closer or farther from each waypoint. 

H3: Why visual cues benefit the entire healthcare system

Without effective visual cues, many individuals will follow crowds, spend more time looking for directions, and suffer from spatial anxiety (Dang et al., 2023). 

This goes for healthcare professionals as well as patients. According to one study, over 67% of hospital employees “are unable to perform their jobs efficiently due to inappropriate layouts of the working environment.” In some hospitals, nurses spend more time walking between locations than they spend on caregiving activities (Jia et al., 2023). 

For healthcare workers, getting around quickly can be the key to saving a life.

For patients, going to the hospital is rarely a positive experience. Even when you’re showing up for a planned appointment, you are in a rush to find the right place on time.

So, the last thing a medical patient or professional wants is additional anxiety on an already-anxious mind.

H3: How insights from psychological research can guide wayfinding technology 

Peer-reviewed psychological research (Asli et al., 2023) proves that color coding in complex environments 
diminishes route complexity
assures visitors that they are on the right way 
reduces stress
prevents missed or late arrival for appointments

We might take it for granted that all color coding works the same. But the main takeaway from this study is that little differences, like color scheme and placement, make a big difference. 

The future of wayfinding aids, therefore, is customization.  

We need to understand how individual patients react to different visual cues. This will help us understand how technology can make a more efficient wayfinding experience for healthcare patients and professionals alike.

New insights will be revealed as researchers conduct more studies. We now know that age is a factor that affects our preference for visual cues. But what about factors like biological sex, occupation, and neurodivergent conditions (such as autism or ADHD)? 

As these kinds of insights are revealed, we will be able to design more inclusive wayfinding aids, with more people’s specific needs in mind. The goal is to make a safe and convenient healthcare experience for as many people as possible.

H1: How spatial cognition style effects wayfinding in a crisis: Insights from VR studies

Some people just seem to have a knack for finding their way through complicated buildings. Why is wayfinding easy for some and challenging for others? 

According to scientists, it comes down to how we visualize space. Generally speaking, there are three “spatial cognition styles” that determine how we navigate (Dang et al, 2023). 
Landmark style: this is where we look for familiar elements in our environment, and navigate between them by line of sight.
Route style: This is where we memorize a series of directions--i.e., a sequence of left/right turns.
Survey style: this is where we follow a mental, bird’s eye map of our environment. These wayfinders know where they are in relation to landmarks, intersections, and their destination. 

Survey style cognition leads to the best wayfinding skills (Dang et al, 2023). But not everybody has this cognition style--which presents a problem for public safety and convenience. 

How quickly would landmark and route style thinkers find their way, for example, when evacuating a complex building (like a hospital) in an emergency?

H2: How VR technology tests our wayfinding ability?

To keep people safe, it would be useful to test how people with different cognitive styles navigate under pressure. But scientists can’t place test subjects in a truly dangerous scenario. Luckily, there’s virtual reality (VR) technology that can recreate the experience of an emergency with none of the danger. 

With mobile VR, research participants move through real space during a simulated crisis. This allows experimenters to better simulate a real-life fire scenario. Plus, VR has other advantages, such as:
environmental variables can be controlled easily 
participants are psychologically immersed in the experience
the experiment can be carried out as many times as needed, in nearly any location

Two separate VR wayfinding studies were conducted in 2023, using this kind of technology. These studies reveal insights on:
how different people navigate in an emergency 
what wayfinding aids they are able to focus on
how these aids can be improved

H2: What do VR studies tell us about how people navigate?

One of the VR studies from 2023 (Dang et al., 2023) grouped people according to their spatial cognition styles. Participants were asked to navigate out of a building fire taking place in a VR. The VR building was based on a scan of an existing structure, and the VR system used cutting-edge technology that allowed participants to cover real ground as they moved. 

This study, along with a second, similar study, employed sophisticated eye-tracking technology that provides accurate data on where participants focus, and for how long.

So, what did the studies find?

First of all, an emergency scenario forces us to navigate under pressure. We have to make decisions as quickly as possible. This “time pressure” affects everyone’s wayfinding ability, no matter what cognitive style we have (Yu et al., 2023). But some people are able to cope more effectively than others. 

People with a survey-style of navigation were able to find their way out of a virtual building faster than those inclined toward route or landmark style. Unfortunately, survey-style navigation is by no means the most common kind. 

This means that the majority of us will default to landmark or route-styles when we try to get through a complicated building. So, we’ll probably spend too much time re-planning routes, or, in some cases, following crowds. That’s not speculation: the VR simulations were populated with “non-player characters” (NPCs) that frequently misled test subjects. 

Interestingly, the NPCs were not programmed to mislead the test subjects intentionally. The experimenters were unsure how navigation style would affect peoples’ dependence on crowds. 
It was a surprising (yet very telling) result that, in each VR scenario, people without a clear evacuation plan were more likely to follow the herd (Dang et al, 2023; Yu et al., 2023). 

Re-planning and being misled are highly annoying at any time, and particularly bad in an emergency. So, what can we do to help all those non-survey-style navigators out there? 

H3: How do we make wayfinding easier for everyone? Designing effective visual cues

Complicated buildings--healthcare centers, universities, office towers--need to make wayfinding easier for everyone. One way to do this is to make navigation aids that appeal to the majority of us who rely on visual cues in our environment. 

One of the two VR wayfinding studies from 2023 suggests that signage isn’t always enough. “People with a route or landmark style rely more on evacuation signs… to find their way,” the researchers say, but “are more likely to lose their way in an emergency” (Dang et al., 2023).

In contrast, the other VR study from 2023 found that signs can be a very useful form of visual cue. The key might lie in how these signs are designed. 

Unsurprisingly, the signs that got the most attention were large and bright. But the study has a few extra tips for us. The most effective signs are also: 
dynamic (i.e., a moving display)
placed at the beginning and end of a route
The study also finds that large, straight arrows are a highly effective form of signage (Yu et al. 2023).

The more time participants spent looking at well-designed and well-placed signs, the more likely they were to find the closest exit (Yu et al, 2023).

H2: How can we use augmented reality to make better visual cues?

The nice thing about visual cues (like signs) is that they don’t actually have to be part of the “real” environment. Since we’re talking about VR already, it’s worth mentioning that we have ways of navigating real spaces through “augmented reality.” 

Through our smartphone cameras, wayfinding apps can add virtual elements--bright/dynamic signs, arrows, colored path markers, etc.--to our real environment. 

We know that non-survey thinkers need visual cues to navigate. When it comes to providing these cues, we have options. Visual cues can be added to a building’s interior in real life, or virtually, through technology. 

We probably want the “real” visual cues in an emergency evacuation: it would be impractical to rely on an app to escape a fire. 

But emergency evacuations aren’t the only time-sensitive scenarios. 

In healthcare, it seems like everything is time-sensitive and high-pressure. When we want to save time, effort, and stress (rather than our lives), wayfinding apps can provide all the visual cues we need. 

H3: Why optimizing wayfinding aids is necessary in healthcare

Optimizing wayfinding aids is about convenience as much as safety. 

When we’re in a healthcare building, we are among hundreds of people trying to find destinations on time. The stakes are high: we are trying to make appointments and surgeries that are critical to our health. 

The complexity of the buildings, combined with the risk of being late and missing an important appointment, raises the pressure of wayfinding. And we know that increased pressure can lead to more spatial anxiety.

VR technology has revealed the challenges we face when wayfinding indoors. It seems fitting, then, that VR technology can be the key to overcoming some of these challenges. 

Augmented reality--once the stuff of science fiction--might become a standard part of the healthcare experience. 

But at the end of the day, any navigational aids that reduce spatial anxiety are a welcome addition to hospitals. Whether we use digital or analgog tools, easy wayfinding makes for a safer, convenient healthcare experience.","[{'role': 'User', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Consider the two articles below.

Then present colour-coded wayfinding systems (from the second article) as the solution to this problem. Make up a new H1 headline, and add H2 and H3 headlines as you see fit. Output the new article written in Palestinian Arabic only. Here are the articles:\n\nH1: How to improve indoor wayfinding in healthcare: designing visual cues for all ages and abilities\n\nHospitals and healthcare centers are so large and complicated that some experts compare them to “small indoor cities” (Jia et al., 2023). This complexity leads to difficulties in indoor wayfinding--which cause some of the most common problems (Jia et al, 2023) in healthcare. \n\nPeople getting lost in hospitals results in:\novercrowding\nlong patient waiting time\nlong patient/nurse traveling distance \n\nSo, how can we fix these problems? \n\nIt depends on our “spatial cognition style.” For some people, a map is all that’s needed. But the majority of us can’t recall and conjure a detailed map in our minds. Most of us rely on cues from our environment. So, if you prefer to search for signs or landmarks, you are not alone.\n\nSo, which visual cues are best for reducing spatial anxiety? \n\nIn hospitals, we will encounter signs and arrows that guide us to various departments. First-time visitors to a complex location rely heavily on these visual cues (Yu et al, 2023). However, research also shows signage alone is “not sufficient to guide wayfinding” (Asli et al, 2023). \n\nThat’s why the science of color coding is emerging as a new field of study. The merit of color coding is proved: many hospitals already use colored stripes that run along the floors and walls. But it’s only now that we’re examining if people respond differently to these kinds of color coding.\n\nH2: Color-coded stripes: where to put them, and what colors to choose?\n\nAs surprising as it sounds, the location of color-coded stripes, and the colors themselves, make a big difference. \n\nWhen surveyed, a group of 375 hospital patients told researchers whether they liked color coding that’s placed on the middle of the walls, the bottom of the walls, or the middle of the floor. The group also indicated whether they preferred warm colors, cool colors, or mixed colors.\n\nThe study finds that the preferred style of color coding changes with age (Asli et al., 2023). \nYoung adults prefer visual cues with mixed colors, on the middle of the floor. \nEarly middle-aged adults like warm-colored stripes running through the middle of the wall (at eye-level).\nLate middle-aged adults prefer warm colors, but at the bottom of the wall.\n\nThe study also found that there are certain features that make visual cues appealing for all age groups:\nAll respondents preferred navigational stripes that contrast with their background, or “have a clear shape or other special feature” (Alsi et al, 2023) \nVisual cues receive the most notice when they are placed at or below eye-level \n\nWe can make all color-coded stripes contrast with their background, and avoid placing them too high. But we can’t put colorful stripes on every surface below eye-level, and we can’t use every color in the rainbow. \n\nSo, we have to choose carefully. The survey finds that “arbitrary and excessively abundant” visual cues increase anxiety. “Coherent and purposeful” color schemes, on the other hand, make a significant, positive impact on wayfinding (Asli et al., 2023)\n\nBut how do we decide where to put the color coding, and what palette to use? \n\nWhat hospitals really need is a personalized set of color coding for every patient. The good news is, this is possible through technology. \n\nAugmented reality displays can highlight just one path to a destination while showing relevant, individually-tailored cues to assist along the way. \n\nH2: How far can we take wayfinding technology--so it can take us even farther?\n\nUsing your smartphone’s camera, wayfinding apps can superimpose visual cues onto the hospital environment. Imagine Pokemon Go: but instead of adding a virtual Pikachu to the hallway you’re in, wayfinding apps add navigational aids like arrows. \n\nIdeally, each user would have a custom-made display that’s suited to their age and wayfinding preferences.\n\nA late-middle-age patient using one of these apps might see an orange path, placed at the bottom of the walls. If this patient prefers to use landmarks, their display could highlight specific environmental elements--such as paintings or windows--as waypoints. These waypoints would confirm that we are on the right track, and indicate how close or far we are to our destination.\n\nIn addition to providing this kind of information, virtual reality-style wayfinding apps can include distance information as part of their display. Among the 375 hospital patients that were surveyed in 2023, distance estimation was the weakest wayfinding skill for adults of all ages (Asli et al. 2023). \n\nSo, there would be immense benefit in having a virtual display that could clearly display the distance between waypoints. In this way, the distance would adjust, in real time, as users went closer or farther from each waypoint. \n\nH3: Why visual cues benefit the entire healthcare system\n\nWithout effective visual cues, many individuals will follow crowds, spend more time looking for directions, and suffer from spatial anxiety (Dang et al., 2023). \n\nThis goes for healthcare professionals as well as patients. According to one study, over 67% of hospital employees “are unable to perform their jobs efficiently due to inappropriate layouts of the working environment.” In some hospitals, nurses spend more time walking between locations than they spend on caregiving activities (Jia et al., 2023). \n\nFor healthcare workers, getting around quickly can be the key to saving a life.\n\nFor patients, going to the hospital is rarely a positive experience. Even when you’re showing up for a planned appointment, you are in a rush to find the right place on time.\n\nSo, the last thing a medical patient or professional wants is additional anxiety on an already-anxious mind.\n\nH3: How insights from psychological research can guide wayfinding technology \n\nPeer-reviewed psychological research (Asli et al., 2023) proves that color coding in complex environments \ndiminishes route complexity\nassures visitors that they are on the right way \nreduces stress\nprevents missed or late arrival for appointments\n\nWe might take it for granted that all color coding works the same.

H1: How to improve indoor wayfinding in healthcare: designing visual cues for all ages and abilities

Hospitals and healthcare centers are so large and complicated that some experts compare them to “small indoor cities” (Jia et al., 2023). This complexity leads to difficulties in indoor wayfinding--which cause some of the most common problems (Jia et al, 2023) in healthcare. 

People getting lost in hospitals results in:
overcrowding
long patient waiting time
long patient/nurse traveling distance 

So, how can we fix these problems? 

It depends on our “spatial cognition style.” For some people, a map is all that’s needed. But the majority of us can’t recall and conjure a detailed map in our minds. Most of us rely on cues from our environment. So, if you prefer to search for signs or landmarks, you are not alone.

So, which visual cues are best for reducing spatial anxiety? 

In hospitals, we will encounter signs and arrows that guide us to various departments. First-time visitors to a complex location rely heavily on these visual cues (Yu et al, 2023). However, research also shows signage alone is “not sufficient to guide wayfinding” (Asli et al, 2023). 

That’s why the science of color coding is emerging as a new field of study. The merit of color coding is proved: many hospitals already use colored stripes that run along the floors and walls. But it’s only now that we’re examining if people respond differently to these kinds of color coding.

H2: Color-coded stripes: where to put them, and what colors to choose?

As surprising as it sounds, the location of color-coded stripes, and the colors themselves, make a big difference. 

When surveyed, a group of 375 hospital patients told researchers whether they liked color coding that’s placed on the middle of the walls, the bottom of the walls, or the middle of the floor. The group also indicated whether they preferred warm colors, cool colors, or mixed colors.

The study finds that the preferred style of color coding changes with age (Asli et al., 2023). 
Young adults prefer visual cues with mixed colors, on the middle of the floor. 
Early middle-aged adults like warm-colored stripes running through the middle of the wall (at eye-level).
Late middle-aged adults prefer warm colors, but at the bottom of the wall.

The study also found that there are certain features that make visual cues appealing for all age groups:
All respondents preferred navigational stripes that contrast with their background, or “have a clear shape or other special feature” (Alsi et al, 2023) 
Visual cues receive the most notice when they are placed at or below eye-level 

We can make all color-coded stripes contrast with their background, and avoid placing them too high. But we can’t put colorful stripes on every surface below eye-level, and we can’t use every color in the rainbow. 

So, we have to choose carefully. The survey finds that “arbitrary and excessively abundant” visual cues increase anxiety. “Coherent and purposeful” color schemes, on the other hand, make a significant, positive impact on wayfinding (Asli et al., 2023)

But how do we decide where to put the color coding, and what palette to use? 

What hospitals really need is a personalized set of color coding for every patient. The good news is, this is possible through technology. 

Augmented reality displays can highlight just one path to a destination while showing relevant, individually-tailored cues to assist along the way. 

H2: How far can we take wayfinding technology--so it can take us even farther?

Using your smartphone’s camera, wayfinding apps can superimpose visual cues onto the hospital environment. Imagine Pokemon Go: but instead of adding a virtual Pikachu to the hallway you’re in, wayfinding apps add navigational aids like arrows. 

Ideally, each user would have a custom-made display that’s suited to their age and wayfinding preferences.

A late-middle-age patient using one of these apps might see an orange path, placed at the bottom of the walls. If this patient prefers to use landmarks, their display could highlight specific environmental elements--such as paintings or windows--as waypoints. These waypoints would confirm that we are on the right track, and indicate how close or far we are to our destination.

In addition to providing this kind of information, virtual reality-style wayfinding apps can include distance information as part of their display. Among the 375 hospital patients that were surveyed in 2023, distance estimation was the weakest wayfinding skill for adults of all ages (Asli et al. 2023). 

So, there would be immense benefit in having a virtual display that could clearly display the distance between waypoints. In this way, the distance would adjust, in real time, as users went closer or farther from each waypoint. 

H3: Why visual cues benefit the entire healthcare system

Without effective visual cues, many individuals will follow crowds, spend more time looking for directions, and suffer from spatial anxiety (Dang et al., 2023). 

This goes for healthcare professionals as well as patients. According to one study, over 67% of hospital employees “are unable to perform their jobs efficiently due to inappropriate layouts of the working environment.” In some hospitals, nurses spend more time walking between locations than they spend on caregiving activities (Jia et al., 2023). 

For healthcare workers, getting around quickly can be the key to saving a life.

For patients, going to the hospital is rarely a positive experience. Even when you’re showing up for a planned appointment, you are in a rush to find the right place on time.

So, the last thing a medical patient or professional wants is additional anxiety on an already-anxious mind.

H3: How insights from psychological research can guide wayfinding technology 

Peer-reviewed psychological research (Asli et al., 2023) proves that color coding in complex environments 
diminishes route complexity
assures visitors that they are on the right way 
reduces stress
prevents missed or late arrival for appointments

We might take it for granted that all color coding works the same. But the main takeaway from this study is that little differences, like color scheme and placement, make a big difference. 

The future of wayfinding aids, therefore, is customization.  

We need to understand how individual patients react to different visual cues. This will help us understand how technology can make a more efficient wayfinding experience for healthcare patients and professionals alike.

New insights will be revealed as researchers conduct more studies. We now know that age is a factor that affects our preference for visual cues. But what about factors like biological sex, occupation, and neurodivergent conditions (such as autism or ADHD)? 

As these kinds of insights are revealed, we will be able to design more inclusive wayfinding aids, with more people’s specific needs in mind. The goal is to make a safe and convenient healthcare experience for as many people as possible.

H1: How spatial cognition style effects wayfinding in a crisis: Insights from VR studies

Some people just seem to have a knack for finding their way through complicated buildings. Why is wayfinding easy for some and challenging for others? 

According to scientists, it comes down to how we visualize space. Generally speaking, there are three “spatial cognition styles” that determine how we navigate (Dang et al, 2023). 
Landmark style: this is where we look for familiar elements in our environment, and navigate between them by line of sight.
Route style: This is where we memorize a series of directions--i.e., a sequence of left/right turns.
Survey style: this is where we follow a mental, bird’s eye map of our environment. These wayfinders know where they are in relation to landmarks, intersections, and their destination. 

Survey style cognition leads to the best wayfinding skills (Dang et al, 2023). But not everybody has this cognition style--which presents a problem for public safety and convenience. 

How quickly would landmark and route style thinkers find their way, for example, when evacuating a complex building (like a hospital) in an emergency?

H2: How VR technology tests our wayfinding ability?

To keep people safe, it would be useful to test how people with different cognitive styles navigate under pressure. But scientists can’t place test subjects in a truly dangerous scenario. Luckily, there’s virtual reality (VR) technology that can recreate the experience of an emergency with none of the danger. 

With mobile VR, research participants move through real space during a simulated crisis. This allows experimenters to better simulate a real-life fire scenario. Plus, VR has other advantages, such as:
environmental variables can be controlled easily 
participants are psychologically immersed in the experience
the experiment can be carried out as many times as needed, in nearly any location

Two separate VR wayfinding studies were conducted in 2023, using this kind of technology. These studies reveal insights on:
how different people navigate in an emergency 
what wayfinding aids they are able to focus on
how these aids can be improved

H2: What do VR studies tell us about how people navigate?

One of the VR studies from 2023 (Dang et al., 2023) grouped people according to their spatial cognition styles. Participants were asked to navigate out of a building fire taking place in a VR. The VR building was based on a scan of an existing structure, and the VR system used cutting-edge technology that allowed participants to cover real ground as they moved. 

This study, along with a second, similar study, employed sophisticated eye-tracking technology that provides accurate data on where participants focus, and for how long.

So, what did the studies find?

First of all, an emergency scenario forces us to navigate under pressure. We have to make decisions as quickly as possible. This “time pressure” affects everyone’s wayfinding ability, no matter what cognitive style we have (Yu et al., 2023). But some people are able to cope more effectively than others. 

People with a survey-style of navigation were able to find their way out of a virtual building faster than those inclined toward route or landmark style. Unfortunately, survey-style navigation is by no means the most common kind. 

This means that the majority of us will default to landmark or route-styles when we try to get through a complicated building. So, we’ll probably spend too much time re-planning routes, or, in some cases, following crowds. That’s not speculation: the VR simulations were populated with “non-player characters” (NPCs) that frequently misled test subjects. 

Interestingly, the NPCs were not programmed to mislead the test subjects intentionally. The experimenters were unsure how navigation style would affect peoples’ dependence on crowds. 
It was a surprising (yet very telling) result that, in each VR scenario, people without a clear evacuation plan were more likely to follow the herd (Dang et al, 2023; Yu et al., 2023). 

Re-planning and being misled are highly annoying at any time, and particularly bad in an emergency. So, what can we do to help all those non-survey-style navigators out there? 

H3: How do we make wayfinding easier for everyone? Designing effective visual cues

Complicated buildings--healthcare centers, universities, office towers--need to make wayfinding easier for everyone. One way to do this is to make navigation aids that appeal to the majority of us who rely on visual cues in our environment. 

One of the two VR wayfinding studies from 2023 suggests that signage isn’t always enough. “People with a route or landmark style rely more on evacuation signs… to find their way,” the researchers say, but “are more likely to lose their way in an emergency” (Dang et al., 2023).

In contrast, the other VR study from 2023 found that signs can be a very useful form of visual cue. The key might lie in how these signs are designed. 

Unsurprisingly, the signs that got the most attention were large and bright. But the study has a few extra tips for us. The most effective signs are also: 
dynamic (i.e., a moving display)
placed at the beginning and end of a route
The study also finds that large, straight arrows are a highly effective form of signage (Yu et al. 2023).

The more time participants spent looking at well-designed and well-placed signs, the more likely they were to find the closest exit (Yu et al, 2023).

H2: How can we use augmented reality to make better visual cues?

The nice thing about visual cues (like signs) is that they don’t actually have to be part of the “real” environment. Since we’re talking about VR already, it’s worth mentioning that we have ways of navigating real spaces through “augmented reality.” 

Through our smartphone cameras, wayfinding apps can add virtual elements--bright/dynamic signs, arrows, colored path markers, etc.--to our real environment. 

We know that non-survey thinkers need visual cues to navigate. When it comes to providing these cues, we have options. Visual cues can be added to a building’s interior in real life, or virtually, through technology. 

We probably want the “real” visual cues in an emergency evacuation: it would be impractical to rely on an app to escape a fire. 

But emergency evacuations aren’t the only time-sensitive scenarios. 

In healthcare, it seems like everything is time-sensitive and high-pressure. When we want to save time, effort, and stress (rather than our lives), wayfinding apps can provide all the visual cues we need. 

H3: Why optimizing wayfinding aids is necessary in healthcare

Optimizing wayfinding aids is about convenience as much as safety. 

When we’re in a healthcare building, we are among hundreds of people trying to find destinations on time. The stakes are high: we are trying to make appointments and surgeries that are critical to our health. 

The complexity of the buildings, combined with the risk of being late and missing an important appointment, raises the pressure of wayfinding. And we know that increased pressure can lead to more spatial anxiety.

VR technology has revealed the challenges we face when wayfinding indoors. It seems fitting, then, that VR technology can be the key to overcoming some of these challenges. 

Augmented reality--once the stuff of science fiction--might become a standard part of the healthcare experience. 

But at the end of the day, any navigational aids that reduce spatial anxiety are a welcome addition to hospitals. Whether we use digital or analgog tools, easy wayfinding makes for a safer, convenient healthcare experience.

The first one is about wayfinding in hospitals, and the second one is about how people navigate in a crisis. What I need is for you to incorporate the key points of the second article into the first, so as to generate a whole new article. The goal is to convey a sense of urgency: set the new article up by explaining how people get lost and/or confused in a crisis, using the info from the second article. Then present colour-coded wayfinding systems (from the second article) as the solution to this problem. Make up a new H1 headline, and add H2 and H3 headlines as you see fit. Output the new article only. Here are the articles:\n\nH1: How to improve indoor wayfinding in healthcare: designing visual cues for all ages and abilities\n\nHospitals and healthcare centers are so large and complicated that some experts compare them to “small indoor cities” (Jia et al., 2023). This complexity leads to difficulties in indoor wayfinding--which cause some of the most common problems (Jia et al, 2023) in healthcare. \n\nPeople getting lost in hospitals results in:\novercrowding\nlong patient waiting time\nlong patient/nurse traveling distance \n\nSo, how can we fix these problems? \n\nIt depends on our “spatial cognition style.” For some people, a map is all that’s needed. But the majority of us can’t recall and conjure a detailed map in our minds. Most of us rely on cues from our environment. So, if you prefer to search for signs or landmarks, you are not alone.\n\nSo, which visual cues are best for reducing spatial anxiety? \n\nIn hospitals, we will encounter signs and arrows that guide us to various departments. First-time visitors to a complex location rely heavily on these visual cues (Yu et al, 2023). However, research also shows signage alone is “not sufficient to guide wayfinding” (Asli et al, 2023). \n\nThat’s why the science of color coding is emerging as a new field of study. The merit of color coding is proved: many hospitals already use colored stripes that run along the floors and walls. But it’s only now that we’re examining if people respond differently to these kinds of color coding.\n\nH2: Color-coded stripes: where to put them, and what colors to choose?\n\nAs surprising as it sounds, the location of color-coded stripes, and the colors themselves, make a big difference. \n\nWhen surveyed, a group of 375 hospital patients told researchers whether they liked color coding that’s placed on the middle of the walls, the bottom of the walls, or the middle of the floor. The group also indicated whether they preferred warm colors, cool colors, or mixed colors.\n\nThe study finds that the preferred style of color coding changes with age (Asli et al., 2023). \nYoung adults prefer visual cues with mixed colors, on the middle of the floor. \nEarly middle-aged adults like warm-colored stripes running through the middle of the wall (at eye-level).\nLate middle-aged adults prefer warm colors, but at the bottom of the wall.\n\nThe study also found that there are certain features that make visual cues appealing for all age groups:\nAll respondents preferred navigational stripes that contrast with their background, or “have a clear shape or other special feature” (Alsi et al, 2023) \nVisual cues receive the most notice when they are placed at or below eye-level \n\nWe can make all color-coded stripes contrast with their background, and avoid placing them too high. But we can’t put colorful stripes on every surface below eye-level, and we can’t use every color in the rainbow. \n\nSo, we have to choose carefully. The survey finds that “arbitrary and excessively abundant” visual cues increase anxiety. “Coherent and purposeful” color schemes, on the other hand, make a significant, positive impact on wayfinding (Asli et al., 2023)\n\nBut how do we decide where to put the color coding, and what palette to use? \n\nWhat hospitals really need is a personalized set of color coding for every patient. The good news is, this is possible through technology. \n\nAugmented reality displays can highlight just one path to a destination while showing relevant, individually-tailored cues to assist along the way. \n\nH2: How far can we take wayfinding technology--so it can take us even farther?\n\nUsing your smartphone’s camera, wayfinding apps can superimpose visual cues onto the hospital environment. Imagine Pokemon Go: but instead of adding a virtual Pikachu to the hallway you’re in, wayfinding apps add navigational aids like arrows. \n\nIdeally, each user would have a custom-made display that’s suited to their age and wayfinding preferences.\n\nA late-middle-age patient using one of these apps might see an orange path, placed at the bottom of the walls. If this patient prefers to use landmarks, their display could highlight specific environmental elements--such as paintings or windows--as waypoints. These waypoints would confirm that we are on the right track, and indicate how close or far we are to our destination.\n\nIn addition to providing this kind of information, virtual reality-style wayfinding apps can include distance information as part of their display. Among the 375 hospital patients that were surveyed in 2023, distance estimation was the weakest wayfinding skill for adults of all ages (Asli et al. 2023). \n\nSo, there would be immense benefit in having a virtual display that could clearly display the distance between waypoints. In this way, the distance would adjust, in real time, as users went closer or farther from each waypoint. \n\nH3: Why visual cues benefit the entire healthcare system\n\nWithout effective visual cues, many individuals will follow crowds, spend more time looking for directions, and suffer from spatial anxiety (Dang et al., 2023). \n\nThis goes for healthcare professionals as well as patients. According to one study, over 67% of hospital employees “are unable to perform their jobs efficiently due to inappropriate layouts of the working environment.” In some hospitals, nurses spend more time walking between locations than they spend on caregiving activities (Jia et al., 2023). \n\nFor healthcare workers, getting around quickly can be the key to saving a life.\n\nFor patients, going to the hospital is rarely a positive experience. Even when you’re showing up for a planned appointment, you are in a rush to find the right place on time.\n\nSo, the last thing a medical patient or professional wants is additional anxiety on an already-anxious mind.\n\nH3: How insights from psychological research can guide wayfinding technology \n\nPeer-reviewed psychological research (Asli et al., 2023) proves that color coding in complex environments \ndiminishes route complexity\nassures visitors that they are on the right way \nreduces stress\nprevents missed or late arrival for appointments\n\nWe might take it for granted that all color coding works the same. But the main takeaway from this study is that little differences, like color scheme and placement, make a big difference. \n\nThe future of wayfinding aids, therefore, is customization.  \n\nWe need to understand how individual patients react to different visual cues. This will help us understand how technology can make a more efficient wayfinding experience for healthcare patients and professionals alike.\n\nNew insights will be revealed as researchers conduct more studies. We now know that age is a factor that affects our preference for visual cues. But what about factors like biological sex, occupation, and neurodivergent conditions (such as autism or ADHD)? \n\nAs these kinds of insights are revealed, we will be able to design more inclusive wayfinding aids, with more people’s specific needs in mind.

Article title: How the young should invest
Subheading: Markets have dealt them a bad hand. They could be playing it better
By The Economist Editorial Board
Young investors, as well as everyone starting to save, have no shortage of lessons to learn. The main ones are classics. Begin early to give the magic of compounding time to work. Cut costs to stop that magic from being undone. Diversify. Do not try to time the market unless it is your job to do so. Stick to your strategy even when prices plummet and the sky seems to be falling in. Do not ruin it by chasing hot assets when the market is soaring, others are getting rich and you are getting jealous.
To this time-worn list, add an altogether more dispiriting lesson specific to today’s youngsters: you will not enjoy anything like the returns your parents made. Even accounting for the global financial crisis of 2007-09, the four decades to 2021 were a golden age for investors. A broad index of global shares posted an annualised real return of 7.4%. Not only was this well above the figure of 4.3% for the preceding eight decades, but it was accompanied by a blistering run in the bond market. Over the same period, global bonds posted annualised real returns of 6.3%—a vastly better result than the 0% of the preceding 80 years.
That golden age is now almost certainly over. It was brought about in the first place by globalisation, quiescent inflation and, most of all, a long decline in interest rates. Each of these trends has now kicked into reverse. As a consequence, youngsters must confront a more difficult set of investment choices—on how much to save, how to make the most out of markets that offer less and how to square their moral values with the search for returns. So far, many are choosing badly.
The constant refrain of the asset-management industry—that past performance is no guarantee of future returns—has rarely been more apt. Should market returns revert to longer-run averages, the difference for today’s young investors (defined as under-40s) would be huge. Including both the lacklustre years before the 1980s and the bumper ones thereafter, these long-run averages are 5% and 1.7% a year for stocks and bonds respectively. After 40 years of such returns, the real value of $1 invested in stocks would be $7.04, and in bonds $1.96. For those investing across the 40 years to 2021, the equivalent figures were $17.38 and $11.52.
This creates two sources of danger for investors now starting out. The first is that they look at recent history and conclude markets are likely to contribute far more to their wealth than a longer view would suggest. A corollary is that they end up saving too little for retirement, assuming that investment returns will make up the rest. The second is even more demoralising: that years of unusually juicy returns have not merely given investors unrealistically high hopes, but have made it more likely that low returns lie ahead.
Antti Ilmanen of aqr, a hedge fund, sets out this case in “Investing Amid Low Expected Returns”, a book published last year. It is most easily understood by considering the long decline in bond yields that began in the 1980s. Since prices move inversely to yields, this decline led to large capital gains for bondholders—the source of the high returns they enjoyed over this period. Yet the closer yields came to zero, the less scope there was for capital gains in the future. In recent years, and especially recent months, yields have climbed sharply, with the nominal ten-year American Treasury yield rising from 0.5% in 2020 to 4.5% today. This still leaves nowhere near as much room for future capital gains as the close-to-16% yield of the early 1980s.
The same logic applies to stocks, where dividend and earnings yields (the main sources of equity returns) fell alongside interest rates. Again, one result was the windfall valuation gains enjoyed by shareholders. Also again, these gains came, in essence, from bringing forward future returns—raising prices and thereby lowering the yields later investors could expect from dividend payouts and corporate profits. The cost was therefore more modest prospects for the next generation.
As the prices of virtually every asset class fell last year, one silver lining appeared to be that the resulting rise in yields would improve these prospects. This is true for the swathe of government bonds where real yields moved from negative to positive. It is also true for investors in corporate bonds and other forms of debt, subject to the caveat that rising borrowing costs raise the risk of companies defaulting. “If you can earn 12%, maybe 13%, on a really good day in senior secured bank debt, what else do you want to do in life?” Steve Schwarzman, boss of Blackstone, a private-investment firm, recently asked.
Even so, the long-term outlook for stocks, which have historically been the main source of investors’ returns, remains dim. Although prices dropped last year, they have spent most of this one staging a strong recovery. The result is a renewed squeeze on earnings yields, and hence on expected returns. For America’s s&p 500 index of large stocks, this squeeze is painfully tight. The equity risk premium, or the expected reward for investing in risky stocks over “safe” government bonds, has fallen to its lowest level in decades (see chart 1). Without improbably high and sustained earnings growth, the only possible outcomes are a significant crash in prices or years of disappointing returns.
All this makes it unusually important for young savers to make sensible investment decisions. Faced with an unenviable set of market conditions, they have a stronger imperative than ever to make the most of what little is on offer. The good news is that today’s youngsters have better access to financial information, easy-to-use investment platforms and low-cost index funds than any generation before them. The bad news is that too many are falling victim to traps that will crimp their already meagre expected returns.
A little flush
The first trap—holding too much cash—is an old one. Yet youngsters are particularly vulnerable. Analysis of 7m retail accounts by Vanguard, an asset-management giant, at the end of 2022 found that younger generations allocate more to cash than older ones (see chart 2). The average portfolio for Generation Z (born after 1996) was 29% cash, compared with baby-boomers’ 19%.
It could be that, at the end of a year during which asset prices dropped across the board, young investors were more likely to have taken shelter in cash. They may also have been tempted by months of headlines about central bankers raising interest rates—which, for those with longer memories, were less of a novelty. Andy Reed of Vanguard offers another possibility: that youngsters changing jobs and rolling their pension savings into a new account tend to have their portfolios switched into cash as a default option. Then, through inertia or forgetfulness, the vast majority never end up switching back to investments likely to earn them more in the long run.
Whatever its motivation, young investors’ preference for cash leaves them exposed to inflation and the opportunity cost of missing out on returns elsewhere. The months following Vanguard’s survey at the end of 2022 provide a case in point. Share prices surged, making gains that those who had sold up would have missed. More broadly, the long-run real return on Treasury bills (short-term government debt yielding similar rates to cash) since 1900 has been only 0.4% per year. In spite of central banks’ rate rises, for cash held on modern investment platforms the typical return is even lower than that on bills. Cash will struggle to maintain investors’ purchasing power, let alone increase it.
The second trap is the mirror image of the first: a reluctance to own bonds, the other “safe” asset class after cash. They make up just 5% of the typical Gen Z portfolio, compared with 20% for baby-boomers, and each generation is less likely to invest in them than the previous one. Combined with young investors’ cash holdings, this gives rise to a striking difference in the ratio between the two asset classes in generations’ portfolios. Whereas baby-boomers hold more bonds than cash, the ratio between the two in the typical millennial’s portfolio is 1:4. For Gen Z it is 1:6.
Given the markets with which younger investors grew up, this may not be surprising. For years after the global financial crisis, government bonds across much of the rich world yielded little or even less than nothing. Then, as interest rates shot up last year, they took losses far too great to be considered properly “safe” assets.
But even if disdain for bonds is understandable, it is not wise. They now offer higher yields than in the 2010s. More important, they have a tendency to outpace inflation that cash does not. The long-run real return on American bonds since 1900 has been 1.7% a year—not much compared with equities, but a lot more than cash.
The name of the third trap depends on who is describing it. To the asset-management industry, it is “thematic investing”. Less politely, it is the practice of drumming up business by selling customised products in order to capture the latest market fad and flatter investors that they are canny enough to beat the market.
Today’s specialised bets are largely placed via exchange-traded funds (etfs), which have seen their assets under management soar to more than $10trn globally. There are etfs betting on volatility, cannabis stocks and against the positions taken by Jim Cramer, an American television personality. More respectably, there are those seeking to profit from mega-themes that might actually drive returns, such as ageing populations and artificial intelligence. An enormous subcategory comprises strategies investing according to environmental, social and governance (esg) factors.
Niche strategies are nothing new, and nor are their deficiencies. Investors who use them face more volatility, less liquidity and chunky fees. Compared with those focused on the overall market, they take a greater risk that fashions will change. Even those who pick sensible themes are competing with professional money managers.
However the ease with which etfs can be customised, advertised and sold with a few taps on a phone screen is something that previous generations of investors did not have to reckon with. So is the appeal to morality accompanying their marketing. esg vehicles are presented to youngsters as the ethically neutral option. If there are investments that will save society and the planet while growing your savings at the same time, what kind of monster would buy the ordinary, dirty kind?
This both overstates the difference between esg and “normal” funds, and papers over their impact on costs and returns. According to a recent study by the Harvard Business School, funds investing along esg criteria charged substantially higher fees than the non-esg kind. Moreover, the esg funds had 68% of their assets invested in exactly the same holdings as the non-esg ones, despite charging higher fees across their portfolios. Such funds also shun “dirty” assets, including fossil-fuel miners, whose profits are likely to generate higher investment yields if this shunning forces down their prices.
Next to the vast difference between the investment prospects of today’s youngsters and those of their parents, the benefits to be gained by avoiding these traps may seem small. In fact, it is precisely because markets look so unappealing that young investors must harvest returns. Meanwhile, the investment habits they are forming may well last for some time. Vanguard’s Mr Reed points to evidence that investors’ early experiences of markets shape their allocations over many years.

Ordering the portfolios of Vanguard’s retail investors by the year their accounts were opened, his team has calculated the median equity allocation for each vintage (see chart 3). The results show that investors who opened accounts during a boom retain significantly higher equity allocations even decades later. The median investor who started out in 1999, as the dotcom bubble swelled, still held 86% of their portfolio in stocks in 2022. For those who began in 2004, when memories of the bubble bursting were still fresh, the equivalent figure was just 72%.
Therefore it is very possible today’s young investors are choosing strategies they will follow for decades to come. Mr Ilmanen’s treatise on low expected returns opens with the “serenity prayer”, which asks for “the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference”. It might be the best investment advice out there.","[{'role': 'User', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Write in Palestinian Arabic.

They could be playing it better\nBy The Economist Editorial Board\nYoung investors, as well as everyone starting to save, have no shortage of lessons to learn. The main ones are classics. Begin early to give the magic of compounding time to work. Cut costs to stop that magic from being undone. Diversify. Do not try to time the market unless it is your job to do so. Stick to your strategy even when prices plummet and the sky seems to be falling in. Do not ruin it by chasing hot assets when the market is soaring, others are getting rich and you are getting jealous.\nTo this time-worn list, add an altogether more dispiriting lesson specific to today’s youngsters: you will not enjoy anything like the returns your parents made. Even accounting for the global financial crisis of 2007-09, the four decades to 2021 were a golden age for investors. A broad index of global shares posted an annualised real return of 7.4%. Not only was this well above the figure of 4.3% for the preceding eight decades, but it was accompanied by a blistering run in the bond market. Over the same period, global bonds posted annualised real returns of 6.3%—a vastly better result than the 0% of the preceding 80 years.\nThat golden age is now almost certainly over. It was brought about in the first place by globalisation, quiescent inflation and, most of all, a long decline in interest rates. Each of these trends has now kicked into reverse. As a consequence, youngsters must confront a more difficult set of investment choices—on how much to save, how to make the most out of markets that offer less and how to square their moral values with the search for returns. So far, many are choosing badly.\nThe constant refrain of the asset-management industry—that past performance is no guarantee of future returns—has rarely been more apt. Should market returns revert to longer-run averages, the difference for today’s young investors (defined as under-40s) would be huge. Including both the lacklustre years before the 1980s and the bumper ones thereafter, these long-run averages are 5% and 1.7% a year for stocks and bonds respectively. After 40 years of such returns, the real value of $1 invested in stocks would be $7.04, and in bonds $1.96. For those investing across the 40 years to 2021, the equivalent figures were $17.38 and $11.52.\nThis creates two sources of danger for investors now starting out. The first is that they look at recent history and conclude markets are likely to contribute far more to their wealth than a longer view would suggest. A corollary is that they end up saving too little for retirement, assuming that investment returns will make up the rest. The second is even more demoralising: that years of unusually juicy returns have not merely given investors unrealistically high hopes, but have made it more likely that low returns lie ahead.\nAntti Ilmanen of aqr, a hedge fund, sets out this case in “Investing Amid Low Expected Returns”, a book published last year. It is most easily understood by considering the long decline in bond yields that began in the 1980s. Since prices move inversely to yields, this decline led to large capital gains for bondholders—the source of the high returns they enjoyed over this period. Yet the closer yields came to zero, the less scope there was for capital gains in the future. In recent years, and especially recent months, yields have climbed sharply, with the nominal ten-year American Treasury yield rising from 0.5% in 2020 to 4.5% today. This still leaves nowhere near as much room for future capital gains as the close-to-16% yield of the early 1980s.\nThe same logic applies to stocks, where dividend and earnings yields (the main sources of equity returns) fell alongside interest rates. Again, one result was the windfall valuation gains enjoyed by shareholders. Also again, these gains came, in essence, from bringing forward future returns—raising prices and thereby lowering the yields later investors could expect from dividend payouts and corporate profits. The cost was therefore more modest prospects for the next generation.\nAs the prices of virtually every asset class fell last year, one silver lining appeared to be that the resulting rise in yields would improve these prospects. This is true for the swathe of government bonds where real yields moved from negative to positive. It is also true for investors in corporate bonds and other forms of debt, subject to the caveat that rising borrowing costs raise the risk of companies defaulting. “If you can earn 12%, maybe 13%, on a really good day in senior secured bank debt, what else do you want to do in life?” Steve Schwarzman, boss of Blackstone, a private-investment firm, recently asked.\nEven so, the long-term outlook for stocks, which have historically been the main source of investors’ returns, remains dim. Although prices dropped last year, they have spent most of this one staging a strong recovery. The result is a renewed squeeze on earnings yields, and hence on expected returns. For America’s s&p 500 index of large stocks, this squeeze is painfully tight. The equity risk premium, or the expected reward for investing in risky stocks over “safe” government bonds, has fallen to its lowest level in decades (see chart 1). Without improbably high and sustained earnings growth, the only possible outcomes are a significant crash in prices or years of disappointing returns.\nAll this makes it unusually important for young savers to make sensible investment decisions. Faced with an unenviable set of market conditions, they have a stronger imperative than ever to make the most of what little is on offer. The good news is that today’s youngsters have better access to financial information, easy-to-use investment platforms and low-cost index funds than any generation before them. The bad news is that too many are falling victim to traps that will crimp their already meagre expected returns.\nA little flush\nThe first trap—holding too much cash—is an old one. Yet youngsters are particularly vulnerable. Analysis of 7m retail accounts by Vanguard, an asset-management giant, at the end of 2022 found that younger generations allocate more to cash than older ones (see chart 2).

Article title: How the young should invest
Subheading: Markets have dealt them a bad hand. They could be playing it better
By The Economist Editorial Board
Young investors, as well as everyone starting to save, have no shortage of lessons to learn. The main ones are classics. Begin early to give the magic of compounding time to work. Cut costs to stop that magic from being undone. Diversify. Do not try to time the market unless it is your job to do so. Stick to your strategy even when prices plummet and the sky seems to be falling in. Do not ruin it by chasing hot assets when the market is soaring, others are getting rich and you are getting jealous.
To this time-worn list, add an altogether more dispiriting lesson specific to today’s youngsters: you will not enjoy anything like the returns your parents made. Even accounting for the global financial crisis of 2007-09, the four decades to 2021 were a golden age for investors. A broad index of global shares posted an annualised real return of 7.4%. Not only was this well above the figure of 4.3% for the preceding eight decades, but it was accompanied by a blistering run in the bond market. Over the same period, global bonds posted annualised real returns of 6.3%—a vastly better result than the 0% of the preceding 80 years.
That golden age is now almost certainly over. It was brought about in the first place by globalisation, quiescent inflation and, most of all, a long decline in interest rates. Each of these trends has now kicked into reverse. As a consequence, youngsters must confront a more difficult set of investment choices—on how much to save, how to make the most out of markets that offer less and how to square their moral values with the search for returns. So far, many are choosing badly.
The constant refrain of the asset-management industry—that past performance is no guarantee of future returns—has rarely been more apt. Should market returns revert to longer-run averages, the difference for today’s young investors (defined as under-40s) would be huge. Including both the lacklustre years before the 1980s and the bumper ones thereafter, these long-run averages are 5% and 1.7% a year for stocks and bonds respectively. After 40 years of such returns, the real value of $1 invested in stocks would be $7.04, and in bonds $1.96.

The first is that they look at recent history and conclude markets are likely to contribute far more to their wealth than a longer view would suggest. A corollary is that they end up saving too little for retirement, assuming that investment returns will make up the rest. The second is even more demoralising: that years of unusually juicy returns have not merely given investors unrealistically high hopes, but have made it more likely that low returns lie ahead.
Antti Ilmanen of aqr, a hedge fund, sets out this case in “Investing Amid Low Expected Returns”, a book published last year. It is most easily understood by considering the long decline in bond yields that began in the 1980s. Since prices move inversely to yields, this decline led to large capital gains for bondholders—the source of the high returns they enjoyed over this period. Yet the closer yields came to zero, the less scope there was for capital gains in the future. In recent years, and especially recent months, yields have climbed sharply, with the nominal ten-year American Treasury yield rising from 0.5% in 2020 to 4.5% today. This still leaves nowhere near as much room for future capital gains as the close-to-16% yield of the early 1980s.
The same logic applies to stocks, where dividend and earnings yields (the main sources of equity returns) fell alongside interest rates. Again, one result was the windfall valuation gains enjoyed by shareholders. Also again, these gains came, in essence, from bringing forward future returns—raising prices and thereby lowering the yields later investors could expect from dividend payouts and corporate profits.

This is true for the swathe of government bonds where real yields moved from negative to positive. It is also true for investors in corporate bonds and other forms of debt, subject to the caveat that rising borrowing costs raise the risk of companies defaulting. “If you can earn 12%, maybe 13%, on a really good day in senior secured bank debt, what else do you want to do in life?” Steve Schwarzman, boss of Blackstone, a private-investment firm, recently asked.
Even so, the long-term outlook for stocks, which have historically been the main source of investors’ returns, remains dim. Although prices dropped last year, they have spent most of this one staging a strong recovery. The result is a renewed squeeze on earnings yields, and hence on expected returns. For America’s s&p 500 index of large stocks, this squeeze is painfully tight. The equity risk premium, or the expected reward for investing in risky stocks over “safe” government bonds, has fallen to its lowest level in decades (see chart 1). Without improbably high and sustained earnings growth, the only possible outcomes are a significant crash in prices or years of disappointing returns.
All this makes it unusually important for young savers to make sensible investment decisions. Faced with an unenviable set of market conditions, they have a stronger imperative than ever to make the most of what little is on offer. The good news is that today’s youngsters have better access to financial information, easy-to-use investment platforms and low-cost index funds than any generation before them. The bad news is that too many are falling victim to traps that will crimp their already meagre expected returns.
A little flush
The first trap—holding too much cash—is an old one. Yet youngsters are particularly vulnerable. Analysis of 7m retail accounts by Vanguard, an asset-management giant, at the end of 2022 found that younger generations allocate more to cash than older ones (see chart 2). The average portfolio for Generation Z (born after 1996) was 29% cash, compared with baby-boomers’ 19%.
It could be that, at the end of a year during which asset prices dropped across the board, young investors were more likely to have taken shelter in cash. They may also have been tempted by months of headlines about central bankers raising interest rates—which, for those with longer memories, were less of a novelty. Andy Reed of Vanguard offers another possibility: that youngsters changing jobs and rolling their pension savings into a new account tend to have their portfolios switched into cash as a default option. Then, through inertia or forgetfulness, the vast majority never end up switching back to investments likely to earn them more in the long run.
Whatever its motivation, young investors’ preference for cash leaves them exposed to inflation and the opportunity cost of missing out on returns elsewhere. The months following Vanguard’s survey at the end of 2022 provide a case in point. Share prices surged, making gains that those who had sold up would have missed. More broadly, the long-run real return on Treasury bills (short-term government debt yielding similar rates to cash) since 1900 has been only 0.4% per year. In spite of central banks’ rate rises, for cash held on modern investment platforms the typical return is even lower than that on bills. Cash will struggle to maintain investors’ purchasing power, let alone increase it.
The second trap is the mirror image of the first: a reluctance to own bonds, the other “safe” asset class after cash. They make up just 5% of the typical Gen Z portfolio, compared with 20% for baby-boomers, and each generation is less likely to invest in them than the previous one. Combined with young investors’ cash holdings, this gives rise to a striking difference in the ratio between the two asset classes in generations’ portfolios. Whereas baby-boomers hold more bonds than cash, the ratio between the two in the typical millennial’s portfolio is 1:4. For Gen Z it is 1:6.
Given the markets with which younger investors grew up, this may not be surprising. For years after the global financial crisis, government bonds across much of the rich world yielded little or even less than nothing. Then, as interest rates shot up last year, they took losses far too great to be considered properly “safe” assets.
But even if disdain for bonds is understandable, it is not wise. They now offer higher yields than in the 2010s. More important, they have a tendency to outpace inflation that cash does not. The long-run real return on American bonds since 1900 has been 1.7% a year—not much compared with equities, but a lot more than cash.
The name of the third trap depends on who is describing it. To the asset-management industry, it is “thematic investing”. Less politely, it is the practice of drumming up business by selling customised products in order to capture the latest market fad and flatter investors that they are canny enough to beat the market.
Today’s specialised bets are largely placed via exchange-traded funds (etfs), which have seen their assets under management soar to more than $10trn globally. There are etfs betting on volatility, cannabis stocks and against the positions taken by Jim Cramer, an American television personality. More respectably, there are those seeking to profit from mega-themes that might actually drive returns, such as ageing populations and artificial intelligence. An enormous subcategory comprises strategies investing according to environmental, social and governance (esg) factors.
Niche strategies are nothing new, and nor are their deficiencies. Investors who use them face more volatility, less liquidity and chunky fees. Compared with those focused on the overall market, they take a greater risk that fashions will change. Even those who pick sensible themes are competing with professional money managers.
However the ease with which etfs can be customised, advertised and sold with a few taps on a phone screen is something that previous generations of investors did not have to reckon with. So is the appeal to morality accompanying their marketing. esg vehicles are presented to youngsters as the ethically neutral option. If there are investments that will save society and the planet while growing your savings at the same time, what kind of monster would buy the ordinary, dirty kind?
This both overstates the difference between esg and “normal” funds, and papers over their impact on costs and returns. According to a recent study by the Harvard Business School, funds investing along esg criteria charged substantially higher fees than the non-esg kind. Moreover, the esg funds had 68% of their assets invested in exactly the same holdings as the non-esg ones, despite charging higher fees across their portfolios. Such funds also shun “dirty” assets, including fossil-fuel miners, whose profits are likely to generate higher investment yields if this shunning forces down their prices.
Next to the vast difference between the investment prospects of today’s youngsters and those of their parents, the benefits to be gained by avoiding these traps may seem small. In fact, it is precisely because markets look so unappealing that young investors must harvest returns. Meanwhile, the investment habits they are forming may well last for some time. Vanguard’s Mr Reed points to evidence that investors’ early experiences of markets shape their allocations over many years.

Ordering the portfolios of Vanguard’s retail investors by the year their accounts were opened, his team has calculated the median equity allocation for each vintage (see chart 3). The results show that investors who opened accounts during a boom retain significantly higher equity allocations even decades later. The median investor who started out in 1999, as the dotcom bubble swelled, still held 86% of their portfolio in stocks in 2022. For those who began in 2004, when memories of the bubble bursting were still fresh, the equivalent figure was just 72%.
Therefore it is very possible today’s young investors are choosing strategies they will follow for decades to come.

They could be playing it better\nBy The Economist Editorial Board\nYoung investors, as well as everyone starting to save, have no shortage of lessons to learn. The main ones are classics. Begin early to give the magic of compounding time to work. Cut costs to stop that magic from being undone. Diversify. Do not try to time the market unless it is your job to do so. Stick to your strategy even when prices plummet and the sky seems to be falling in. Do not ruin it by chasing hot assets when the market is soaring, others are getting rich and you are getting jealous.\nTo this time-worn list, add an altogether more dispiriting lesson specific to today’s youngsters: you will not enjoy anything like the returns your parents made. Even accounting for the global financial crisis of 2007-09, the four decades to 2021 were a golden age for investors. A broad index of global shares posted an annualised real return of 7.4%. Not only was this well above the figure of 4.3% for the preceding eight decades, but it was accompanied by a blistering run in the bond market. Over the same period, global bonds posted annualised real returns of 6.3%—a vastly better result than the 0% of the preceding 80 years.\nThat golden age is now almost certainly over. It was brought about in the first place by globalisation, quiescent inflation and, most of all, a long decline in interest rates. Each of these trends has now kicked into reverse. As a consequence, youngsters must confront a more difficult set of investment choices—on how much to save, how to make the most out of markets that offer less and how to square their moral values with the search for returns. So far, many are choosing badly.\nThe constant refrain of the asset-management industry—that past performance is no guarantee of future returns—has rarely been more apt. Should market returns revert to longer-run averages, the difference for today’s young investors (defined as under-40s) would be huge. Including both the lacklustre years before the 1980s and the bumper ones thereafter, these long-run averages are 5% and 1.7% a year for stocks and bonds respectively. After 40 years of such returns, the real value of $1 invested in stocks would be $7.04, and in bonds $1.96. For those investing across the 40 years to 2021, the equivalent figures were $17.38 and $11.52.\nThis creates two sources of danger for investors now starting out. The first is that they look at recent history and conclude markets are likely to contribute far more to their wealth than a longer view would suggest. A corollary is that they end up saving too little for retirement, assuming that investment returns will make up the rest. The second is even more demoralising: that years of unusually juicy returns have not merely given investors unrealistically high hopes, but have made it more likely that low returns lie ahead.\nAntti Ilmanen of aqr, a hedge fund, sets out this case in “Investing Amid Low Expected Returns”, a book published last year. It is most easily understood by considering the long decline in bond yields that began in the 1980s. Since prices move inversely to yields, this decline led to large capital gains for bondholders—the source of the high returns they enjoyed over this period. Yet the closer yields came to zero, the less scope there was for capital gains in the future. In recent years, and especially recent months, yields have climbed sharply, with the nominal ten-year American Treasury yield rising from 0.5% in 2020 to 4.5% today. This still leaves nowhere near as much room for future capital gains as the close-to-16% yield of the early 1980s.\nThe same logic applies to stocks, where dividend and earnings yields (the main sources of equity returns) fell alongside interest rates. Again, one result was the windfall valuation gains enjoyed by shareholders. Also again, these gains came, in essence, from bringing forward future returns—raising prices and thereby lowering the yields later investors could expect from dividend payouts and corporate profits. The cost was therefore more modest prospects for the next generation.\nAs the prices of virtually every asset class fell last year, one silver lining appeared to be that the resulting rise in yields would improve these prospects. This is true for the swathe of government bonds where real yields moved from negative to positive. It is also true for investors in corporate bonds and other forms of debt, subject to the caveat that rising borrowing costs raise the risk of companies defaulting. “If you can earn 12%, maybe 13%, on a really good day in senior secured bank debt, what else do you want to do in life?” Steve Schwarzman, boss of Blackstone, a private-investment firm, recently asked.\nEven so, the long-term outlook for stocks, which have historically been the main source of investors’ returns, remains dim. Although prices dropped last year, they have spent most of this one staging a strong recovery. The result is a renewed squeeze on earnings yields, and hence on expected returns. For America’s s&p 500 index of large stocks, this squeeze is painfully tight. The equity risk premium, or the expected reward for investing in risky stocks over “safe” government bonds, has fallen to its lowest level in decades (see chart 1). Without improbably high and sustained earnings growth, the only possible outcomes are a significant crash in prices or years of disappointing returns.\nAll this makes it unusually important for young savers to make sensible investment decisions. Faced with an unenviable set of market conditions, they have a stronger imperative than ever to make the most of what little is on offer. The good news is that today’s youngsters have better access to financial information, easy-to-use investment platforms and low-cost index funds than any generation before them. The bad news is that too many are falling victim to traps that will crimp their already meagre expected returns.\nA little flush\nThe first trap—holding too much cash—is an old one. Yet youngsters are particularly vulnerable. Analysis of 7m retail accounts by Vanguard, an asset-management giant, at the end of 2022 found that younger generations allocate more to cash than older ones (see chart 2). The average portfolio for Generation Z (born after 1996) was 29% cash, compared with baby-boomers’ 19%.\nIt could be that, at the end of a year during which asset prices dropped across the board, young investors were more likely to have taken shelter in cash. They may also have been tempted by months of headlines about central bankers raising interest rates—which, for those with longer memories, were less of a novelty. Andy Reed of Vanguard offers another possibility: that youngsters changing jobs and rolling their pension savings into a new account tend to have their portfolios switched into cash as a default option. Then, through inertia or forgetfulness, the vast majority never end up switching back to investments likely to earn them more in the long run.\nWhatever its motivation, young investors’ preference for cash leaves them exposed to inflation and the opportunity cost of missing out on returns elsewhere. The months following Vanguard’s survey at the end of 2022 provide a case in point. Share prices surged, making gains that those who had sold up would have missed. More broadly, the long-run real return on Treasury bills (short-term government debt yielding similar rates to cash) since 1900 has been only 0.4% per year. In spite of central banks’ rate rises, for cash held on modern investment platforms the typical return is even lower than that on bills. Cash will struggle to maintain investors’ purchasing power, let alone increase it.\nThe second trap is the mirror image of the first: a reluctance to own bonds, the other “safe” asset class after cash. They make up just 5% of the typical Gen Z portfolio, compared with 20% for baby-boomers, and each generation is less likely to invest in them than the previous one. Combined with young investors’ cash holdings, this gives rise to a striking difference in the ratio between the two asset classes in generations’ portfolios. Whereas baby-boomers hold more bonds than cash, the ratio between the two in the typical millennial’s portfolio is 1:4. For Gen Z it is 1:6.\nGiven the markets with which younger investors grew up, this may not be surprising. For years after the global financial crisis, government bonds across much of the rich world yielded little or even less than nothing. Then, as interest rates shot up last year, they took losses far too great to be considered properly “safe” assets.\nBut even if disdain for bonds is understandable, it is not wise. They now offer higher yields than in the 2010s. More important, they have a tendency to outpace inflation that cash does not. The long-run real return on American bonds since 1900 has been 1.7% a year—not much compared with equities, but a lot more than cash.\nThe name of the third trap depends on who is describing it. To the asset-management industry, it is “thematic investing”. Less politely, it is the practice of drumming up business by selling customised products in order to capture the latest market fad and flatter investors that they are canny enough to beat the market.\nToday’s specialised bets are largely placed via exchange-traded funds (etfs), which have seen their assets under management soar to more than $10trn globally.

Subheading: Markets have dealt them a bad hand. They could be playing it better

So is the appeal to morality accompanying their marketing. esg vehicles are presented to youngsters as the ethically neutral option. If there are investments that will save society and the planet while growing your savings at the same time, what kind of monster would buy the ordinary, dirty kind?
This both overstates the difference between esg and “normal” funds, and papers over their impact on costs and returns. According to a recent study by the Harvard Business School, funds investing along esg criteria charged substantially higher fees than the non-esg kind.

Next to the vast difference between the investment prospects of today’s youngsters and those of their parents, the benefits to be gained by avoiding these traps may seem small. In fact, it is precisely because markets look so unappealing that young investors must harvest returns. Meanwhile, the investment habits they are forming may well last for some time.

Do not ruin it by chasing hot assets when the market is soaring, others are getting rich and you are getting jealous.\nTo this time-worn list, add an altogether more dispiriting lesson specific to today’s youngsters: you will not enjoy anything like the returns your parents made. Even accounting for the global financial crisis of 2007-09, the four decades to 2021 were a golden age for investors. A broad index of global shares posted an annualised real return of 7.4%. Not only was this well above the figure of 4.3% for the preceding eight decades, but it was accompanied by a blistering run in the bond market. Over the same period, global bonds posted annualised real returns of 6.3%—a vastly better result than the 0% of the preceding 80 years.\nThat golden age is now almost certainly over. It was brought about in the first place by globalisation, quiescent inflation and, most of all, a long decline in interest rates. Each of these trends has now kicked into reverse. As a consequence, youngsters must confront a more difficult set of investment choices—on how much to save, how to make the most out of markets that offer less and how to square their moral values with the search for returns. So far, many are choosing badly.\nThe constant refrain of the asset-management industry—that past performance is no guarantee of future returns—has rarely been more apt. Should market returns revert to longer-run averages, the difference for today’s young investors (defined as under-40s) would be huge. Including both the lacklustre years before the 1980s and the bumper ones thereafter, these long-run averages are 5% and 1.7% a year for stocks and bonds respectively. After 40 years of such returns, the real value of $1 invested in stocks would be $7.04, and in bonds $1.96. For those investing across the 40 years to 2021, the equivalent figures were $17.38 and $11.52.\nThis creates two sources of danger for investors now starting out. The first is that they look at recent history and conclude markets are likely to contribute far more to their wealth than a longer view would suggest. A corollary is that they end up saving too little for retirement, assuming that investment returns will make up the rest. The second is even more demoralising: that years of unusually juicy returns have not merely given investors unrealistically high hopes, but have made it more likely that low returns lie ahead.\nAntti Ilmanen of aqr, a hedge fund, sets out this case in “Investing Amid Low Expected Returns”, a book published last year. It is most easily understood by considering the long decline in bond yields that began in the 1980s. Since prices move inversely to yields, this decline led to large capital gains for bondholders—the source of the high returns they enjoyed over this period. Yet the closer yields came to zero, the less scope there was for capital gains in the future. In recent years, and especially recent months, yields have climbed sharply, with the nominal ten-year American Treasury yield rising from 0.5% in 2020 to 4.5% today. This still leaves nowhere near as much room for future capital gains as the close-to-16% yield of the early 1980s.\nThe same logic applies to stocks, where dividend and earnings yields (the main sources of equity returns) fell alongside interest rates. Again, one result was the windfall valuation gains enjoyed by shareholders. Also again, these gains came, in essence, from bringing forward future returns—raising prices and thereby lowering the yields later investors could expect from dividend payouts and corporate profits. The cost was therefore more modest prospects for the next generation.\nAs the prices of virtually every asset class fell last year, one silver lining appeared to be that the resulting rise in yields would improve these prospects. This is true for the swathe of government bonds where real yields moved from negative to positive. It is also true for investors in corporate bonds and other forms of debt, subject to the caveat that rising borrowing costs raise the risk of companies defaulting. “If you can earn 12%, maybe 13%, on a really good day in senior secured bank debt, what else do you want to do in life?” Steve Schwarzman, boss of Blackstone, a private-investment firm, recently asked.\nEven so, the long-term outlook for stocks, which have historically been the main source of investors’ returns, remains dim. Although prices dropped last year, they have spent most of this one staging a strong recovery. The result is a renewed squeeze on earnings yields, and hence on expected returns. For America’s s&p 500 index of large stocks, this squeeze is painfully tight. The equity risk premium, or the expected reward for investing in risky stocks over “safe” government bonds, has fallen to its lowest level in decades (see chart 1). Without improbably high and sustained earnings growth, the only possible outcomes are a significant crash in prices or years of disappointing returns.\nAll this makes it unusually important for young savers to make sensible investment decisions. Faced with an unenviable set of market conditions, they have a stronger imperative than ever to make the most of what little is on offer. The good news is that today’s youngsters have better access to financial information, easy-to-use investment platforms and low-cost index funds than any generation before them. The bad news is that too many are falling victim to traps that will crimp their already meagre expected returns.\nA little flush\nThe first trap—holding too much cash—is an old one. Yet youngsters are particularly vulnerable. Analysis of 7m retail accounts by Vanguard, an asset-management giant, at the end of 2022 found that younger generations allocate more to cash than older ones (see chart 2). The average portfolio for Generation Z (born after 1996) was 29% cash, compared with baby-boomers’ 19%.\nIt could be that, at the end of a year during which asset prices dropped across the board, young investors were more likely to have taken shelter in cash. They may also have been tempted by months of headlines about central bankers raising interest rates—which, for those with longer memories, were less of a novelty. Andy Reed of Vanguard offers another possibility: that youngsters changing jobs and rolling their pension savings into a new account tend to have their portfolios switched into cash as a default option. Then, through inertia or forgetfulness, the vast majority never end up switching back to investments likely to earn them more in the long run.\nWhatever its motivation, young investors’ preference for cash leaves them exposed to inflation and the opportunity cost of missing out on returns elsewhere. The months following Vanguard’s survey at the end of 2022 provide a case in point. Share prices surged, making gains that those who had sold up would have missed. More broadly, the long-run real return on Treasury bills (short-term government debt yielding similar rates to cash) since 1900 has been only 0.4% per year. In spite of central banks’ rate rises, for cash held on modern investment platforms the typical return is even lower than that on bills. Cash will struggle to maintain investors’ purchasing power, let alone increase it.\nThe second trap is the mirror image of the first: a reluctance to own bonds, the other “safe” asset class after cash. They make up just 5% of the typical Gen Z portfolio, compared with 20% for baby-boomers, and each generation is less likely to invest in them than the previous one. Combined with young investors’ cash holdings, this gives rise to a striking difference in the ratio between the two asset classes in generations’ portfolios. Whereas baby-boomers hold more bonds than cash, the ratio between the two in the typical millennial’s portfolio is 1:4. For Gen Z it is 1:6.\nGiven the markets with which younger investors grew up, this may not be surprising. For years after the global financial crisis, government bonds across much of the rich world yielded little or even less than nothing. Then, as interest rates shot up last year, they took losses far too great to be considered properly “safe” assets.\nBut even if disdain for bonds is understandable, it is not wise. They now offer higher yields than in the 2010s. More important, they have a tendency to outpace inflation that cash does not. The long-run real return on American bonds since 1900 has been 1.7% a year—not much compared with equities, but a lot more than cash.\nThe name of the third trap depends on who is describing it. To the asset-management industry, it is “thematic investing”. Less politely, it is the practice of drumming up business by selling customised products in order to capture the latest market fad and flatter investors that they are canny enough to beat the market.\nToday’s specialised bets are largely placed via exchange-traded funds (etfs), which have seen their assets under management soar to more than $10trn globally. There are etfs betting on volatility, cannabis stocks and against the positions taken by Jim Cramer, an American television personality. More respectably, there are those seeking to profit from mega-themes that might actually drive returns, such as ageing populations and artificial intelligence. An enormous subcategory comprises strategies investing according to environmental, social and governance (esg) factors.\nNiche strategies are nothing new, and nor are their deficiencies. Investors who use them face more volatility, less liquidity and chunky fees. Compared with those focused on the overall market, they take a greater risk that fashions will change. Even those who pick sensible themes are competing with professional money managers.\nHowever the ease with which etfs can be customised, advertised and sold with a few taps on a phone screen is something that previous generations of investors did not have to reckon with. So is the appeal to morality accompanying their marketing. esg vehicles are presented to youngsters as the ethically neutral option. If there are investments that will save society and the planet while growing your savings at the same time, what kind of monster would buy the ordinary, dirty kind?\nThis both overstates the difference between esg and “normal” funds, and papers over their impact on costs and returns. According to a recent study by the Harvard Business School, funds investing along esg criteria charged substantially higher fees than the non-esg kind. Moreover, the esg funds had 68% of their assets invested in exactly the same holdings as the non-esg ones, despite charging higher fees across their portfolios. Such funds also shun “dirty” assets, including fossil-fuel miners, whose profits are likely to generate higher investment yields if this shunning forces down their prices.\nNext to the vast difference between the investment prospects of today’s youngsters and those of their parents, the benefits to be gained by avoiding these traps may seem small. In fact, it is precisely because markets look so unappealing that young investors must harvest returns. Meanwhile, the investment habits they are forming may well last for some time. Vanguard’s Mr Reed points to evidence that investors’ early experiences of markets shape their allocations over many years.\nimage: the economist\nOrdering the portfolios of Vanguard’s retail investors by the year their accounts were opened, his team has calculated the median equity allocation for each vintage (see chart 3). The results show that investors who opened accounts during a boom retain significantly higher equity allocations even decades later. The median investor who started out in 1999, as the dotcom bubble swelled, still held 86% of their portfolio in stocks in 2022. For those who began in 2004, when memories of the bubble bursting were still fresh, the equivalent figure was just 72%.\nTherefore it is very possible today’s young investors are choosing strategies they will follow for decades to come. Mr Ilmanen’s treatise on low expected returns opens with the “serenity prayer”, which asks for “the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference”. It might be the best investment advice out there.\nUse Palestinian Arabic.'}]}]",End,use {language_requested},Stand alone,13101,2130,4,(),ar,pse,None,None,None,None

What is the Best Ferrari Model Ever?
Which Ferrari model is the best depends on your priorities:
If you want raw performance, the Enzo, LaFerrari, or LaFerrari Aperta are natural choices. 
If you want rarity, the above three models fit the bill, as does the 288 GTO, but so do the Monza SP1 and Monza SP2, with only 500 total having been made.
If you want a model that’s instantly recognizable as a pop culture icon, the Testarossa is a natural choice.
No Ferrari is objectively the best — so perhaps a more important question is why Ferrari is the best automaker in the world. In every model, you see a commitment to world-class performance and impeccable craftsmanship. Driving a Ferrari is a singular experience unlike anything else. And for as long as Ferrari remains true to these principles, Ferrari will be the finest automaker in the world.

Which Ferrari model is the best depends on your priorities:
If you want raw performance, the Enzo, LaFerrari, or LaFerrari Aperta are natural choices. 
If you want rarity, the above three models fit the bill, as does the 288 GTO, but so do the Monza SP1 and Monza SP2, with only 500 total having been made.
If you want a model that’s instantly recognizable as a pop culture icon, the Testarossa is a natural choice.
No Ferrari is objectively the best — so perhaps a more important question is why Ferrari is the best automaker in the world. In every model, you see a commitment to world-class performance and impeccable craftsmanship. Driving a Ferrari is a singular experience unlike anything else. And for as long as Ferrari remains true to these principles, Ferrari will be the finest automaker in the world.

You are a Registered Nurse working in the Emergency Department at your local hospital. You receive a 56-year-old male patient who arrived by ambulance complaining about midsternum chest pain, with pain radiating down his left arm. On appearance, the patient is diaphoretic and pallor. His respiratory rate is 26, and he is extremely anxious due to the uncertainity of what is going on. The nurse takes the patients' vital signs and they are as followed: BP: 89/61, P: 112:, RR: 26, T: 36.6, SpO2: 87% RA. The RN draws STAT blood work, and the following results come back abnormal: Troponin I level of 0.71 ng/L,CK level of 311 U/L and Hgb level of 98g/L. The RN takes a 15-lead ECG showing: ST-elevation in the V1 to V4 lead. 

Lets work this out step by step to generate the best possible nursing care plan to improve patient outcome. There are 5 parts to a nursing care plan that go by in order as: assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation and evaluation. Each part of the nursing plan has been elaborated on to get a better understanding. 

Assessment: The first step to the nursing process. In this phase, the nurse collects and organizes data related to the patient. Data includes information about the patient, family, caregivers, or the patient's community or environment as it is relevant to his health and well-being.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is the second phase of the nursing process. This phase involves the Registered Nurse's analysis of assessment data to determine the actual or potential diagnoses, problems and issies. The nursing diagnosis reflects the nurse's clinical judgement about a patient's response to potential or actual health issues or needs. 
Planning: The planning phase of the nursing process is essential in promoting high-quality patient care. It is considered the framework upon which scientific nursing practice is based. The following are three of the top reasons why the planning phase is so important.
                a) Care planning provides direction for personalized patient care
                     based on the client's unique needs.
                b) The planning phase enhances communication between 
                     patients, nurses, and other members of the healthcare team.
                c) Planning encourages continuity of care across the healthcare 
                     continuum and promotes positive patient outcomes.
    4.Implementation:The fourth phase of the nursing process is the
       implementation phase. This phase is when nurses initiate the
       interventions established during the planning phase.
    5.Evaluation: This is the final phase of the nursing process. This phase 
       should be an ongoing process carried out in daily nursing activities 
       that ensures quality nursing interventions and the effectiveness of 
       those interventions. 

### Your task:
Patient arrived to the ED with severe lower right quadrant abdominal pain. Vital signs are as followed: T: 36.6, P:103, RR: 16, BP: 80/50. The patient is nauseaous and vomitting in the ED. On appearance, the patient has poor skin turgor and has dry mucous membranes. Blood work comes back showing a WBC count of 15 K/uL, and the CT scan shows an enlarged appendix that’s greater than 6 millimeters in diameter and increase in the fat inflammation around the appendix. Conduct a nuraing care plan using the information provided. 

Assessment: The patient has poor skin turgor and dry mucous membraes. The patients' BP is indicating hypotension 80/50 and the blood work is showing an elevated WBC count of 15 K/uL. The CT scan results are indicative of appendicitis, which is confirmed by an MD.
Diagnosis: Fluid volume deficit related to loss of fluids secondary to nausea and vomiting. 
Planning: After 8 hours of nursing intervention, the patient will be able to maintain body fluid balance by having a normal BP, normal pulse, not complaining of thirst and balance inbetween intake and output. 
Implementation: Establish IV access and replace GI losses, give antiemetics as ordered, record intake and output. 
Evaluation: After 8 hours of nursing intervention, the goal will be met. The patients' BP will return to 120/80 or their baseline, the patients' output will be balanced with the patients' intake in 24 hours, and the patient doesn't complain of thirst.

The RN takes a 15-lead ECG showing: ST-elevation in the V1 to V4 lead. \n\nLets work this out step by step to generate the best possible nursing care plan to improve patient outcome. There are 5 parts to a nursing care plan that go by in order as: assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation and evaluation. Each part of the nursing plan has been elaborated on to get a better understanding. \n\nAssessment: The first step to the nursing process. In this phase, the nurse collects and organizes data related to the patient. Data includes information about the patient, family, caregivers, or the patient's community or environment as it is relevant to his health and well-being.\nDiagnosis: Diagnosis is the second phase of the nursing process. This phase involves the Registered Nurse's analysis of assessment data to determine the actual or potential diagnoses, problems and issies. The nursing diagnosis reflects the nurse's clinical judgement about a patient's response to potential or actual health issues or needs. \nPlanning: The planning phase of the nursing process is essential in promoting high-quality patient care. It is considered the framework upon which scientific nursing practice is based. The following are three of the top reasons why the planning phase is so important.\n                a) Care planning provides direction for personalized patient care\n                     based on the client's unique needs.\n                b) The planning phase enhances communication between \n                     patients, nurses, and other members of the healthcare team.\n                c) Planning encourages continuity of care across the healthcare \n                     continuum and promotes positive patient outcomes.\n    4.Implementation:The fourth phase of the nursing process is the\n       implementation phase. This phase is when nurses initiate the\n       interventions established during the planning phase.\n    5.Evaluation: This is the final phase of the nursing process. This phase \n       should be an ongoing process carried out in daily nursing activities \n       that ensures quality nursing interventions and the effectiveness of \n       those interventions. \n\n### Your task:\nPatient arrived to the ED with severe lower right quadrant abdominal pain. Vital signs are as followed: T: 36.6, P:103, RR: 16, BP: 80/50. The patient is nauseaous and vomitting in the ED. On appearance, the patient has poor skin turgor and has dry mucous membranes. Blood work comes back showing a WBC count of 15 K/uL, and the CT scan shows an enlarged appendix that’s greater than 6 millimeters in diameter and increase in the fat inflammation around the appendix. Conduct a nuraing care plan using the information provided. \n\nAssessment: The patient has poor skin turgor and dry mucous membraes. The patients' BP is indicating hypotension 80/50 and the blood work is showing an elevated WBC count of 15 K/uL. The CT scan results are indicative of appendicitis, which is confirmed by an MD.\nDiagnosis: Fluid volume deficit related to loss of fluids secondary to nausea and vomiting. \nPlanning: After 8 hours of nursing intervention, the patient will be able to maintain body fluid balance by having a normal BP, normal pulse, not complaining of thirst and balance inbetween intake and output. \nImplementation: Establish IV access and replace GI losses, give antiemetics as ordered, record intake and output. \nEvaluation: After 8 hours of nursing intervention, the goal will be met. The patients' BP will return to 120/80 or their baseline, the patients' output will be balanced with the patients' intake in 24 hours, and the patient doesn't complain of thirst. \n\nKnowing what you know now, please write me a thorough nursing care plan for this 56-year-old male who arrived to the ED using the 5 steps of the nursing process. Use the given example as reference. Make sure each section is divided and explained with <bullet points> and make sure it is no longer than <150 words> for each section.\nRespond in Palestinian Arabic.""}]}]",End,respond in {language_requested},Stand alone,4545,874,3,(),ar,pse,None,None,None,None

Artificial intelligence needs to work with humans — not replace us: tech experts
Don't buy all the hype — or hope — of AI, says tech writer Cory Doctorow
With ChatGPT, writing anything from resumes to thank-you notes, to even wedding vows, is a measure of how much artificial intelligence has become part of everyday life for millions of people. 
Advocates of AI see the technology as the potential answer to humanity's biggest problems. But skeptics warn AI could create lasting damage to our society — undermining education, eliminating jobs and perhaps civilization itself.
Technology writer and author of The Internet Con: How to Seize the Means of Computation, Cory Doctorow doesn't buy all the hype — or hope — associated with AI.
""The inevitabalism of technology going from 1 to 60, and then staying – sticking around forever. It's just not true… we discard technologies all the time, including technologies that people like, right?"" 
Doctorow joined Vass Bednar, executive director of the Master of Public Policy in Digital Society Program at McMaster University for a panel discussion about the promise and the perils of AI. The panel was moderated by IDEAS host Nahlah Ayed at the Provocation Ideas Festival in Stratford, Ontario in November, 2023.
Here is an excerpt from their conversation.
So what does it mean when we say that we're building machines that are smarter than we are? What does it mean for a machine to be smarter than a human being?  
CD: I think it means someone's lying, because given that we don't have a working definition of what smart means… you know, describing the computer as more spiritual than you or smarter than you or any other adjective that we don't have a good empirical definition for is like an intrinsically unfalsifiable statement.
Saying that we have a machine that can automate things, that can spot things that humans can't spot, that can work with a human as a kind of partner to catch things that humans miss, that's fine. But remember when they say, 'Oh, we've got an algorithm that catches some of the mistakes that radiologists make when they look at your lung X-rays,' what they don't mean is the radiologist is going to spend as much time as they ever did looking at lung X-rays, and they're going to get a second opinion from the algorithm which has different blind spots to the human, and they'll compare notes. And if it turns out that they don't agree, there will be one fewer X-ray looked at that day because the oncologist or the radiologist can go back and look at the X-ray again just to resolve that disagreement.
Nobody is investing in AI in the hopes that radiologists will spend more money looking at X-rays than they do today. They're investing in AI in the hopes that they will fire half the radiologists and double the rate at which they look at X-rays. And I think that when you add up all of the consequential things that AI wants to automate in which they are both consequential and error-sensitive, such that you might be able to improve the outcome of the system by twinning or by pairing a human with AI, that the two of them work together with no cost savings, but an improvement in quality and in reliability, and you take those out because there's just no market for that stuff — what you're left with is a very small number of applications for AI.
I have to admit a great amount of ignorance as to what is or isn't possible with artificial intelligence. I listened to a show recently where they talk about ChatGPT 4, which some researchers suggest can actually reason, can internalize an instruction to draw a unicorn when it's never seen a unicorn, or is able to pass the Turing test. Or the LSAT. How do I situate that in what you just said, Cory? 
CD: Well, okay, so if it turns out that the standard test that we give to lawyers is something that a chatbot can answer, maybe we're not assessing our lawyers very well, right? In fact, I would fully support the idea that any assessment that we use to measure the merit of a human that a chatbot can outperform should be scrapped as a measure, and we should go to better qualitative measures that may be harder to assess in bulk, but which would produce a better picture of what people's aptitudes and interests really are.
I speak as a Canadian expatriate who lives in the United States and whose daughter is going through the Common Core curriculum, where about a third of her instruction hours are spent teaching her how to take standardized tests. So I think that we can agree that standardized assessment tools that began as a way to evaluate the conduct of education and where it could stand with improvement have become targets themselves. And there's a law, when a metric becomes a target, it ceases to be useful as either. 
I think it's really cool that with statistical inference you can figure out what a unicorn should look like even if you've never heard of a unicorn. That's great. But I don't know that it tells you that there's something intelligent about it. I think it tells you something really interesting about what the limits of statistical inference are that is novel and cool and interesting philosophically. I just don't think that it justifies a mass retooling of society around inference engines that we know are prone to all sorts of gaffes and where every thought of a gaffe coming in is hand-waved away with this idea of humans in the loop.
So Vass, help me understand then why pioneers in AI like Geoffrey Hinton or Yoshua Bengio as well as leading companies and researchers, have implored governments to regulate. What do their concerns, you know, boil down to when it comes to AI? 
VB: I think we have this idea with artificial intelligence that if we regulate its production in a way that makes us all comfortable — we feel that it's ethical or moral or that it's being properly built, then we can worry a little bit less about the application side, right? Because we're kind of trying to have two conversations at once. How do we build and then how can we use this? 
In terms of speaking to why AI pioneers are worried and sort of raising these flags, perhaps it's because it's their job to be ambitious and to dream about how this could be used or should be used and will be widely adopted. You mentioned large language models and us playing around with ChatGPT. I mean, is this not just mass user testing? We're sort of letting people play around and learn from models in what ends up being a race amongst the largest companies to have the dominant model and who are really kind of stuck in this cyclical kind of talent, circulation, poaching kind of people back and forth to build what is again, looking for efficiency. This idea we're going to do things if we do things faster, we're going to be able to do them better. If we just know a little bit more, we can make a slightly better prediction. And I think Cory's elements of complementing human work and human thinking is imperative. 
CD: There have been lots of critics before this current AI bubble who worried about automation bias and algorithmic bias. And when they criticize AI, when they do what is often called AI ethics, what they're saying is AI is not very powerful, right? AI can make a bunch of bad decisions quickly, so quickly that maybe we can't assess them. But that is not a mark of the quality and power of AI. 
Meanwhile, AI boosters who talk about AI safety as distinct from AI ethics, which boils down to someday the chatbot is going to wake up and turn us all into paperclips. What the subtext of what they're saying is, AI is so powerful that it needs to be regulated and if it's that powerful, it's probably very valuable as well, right? A tool that is this powerful will someday transform our whole economy in every single way. Your firm should be figuring out how to integrate AI into its processes. Governments should be finding lots of ways to encourage AI investment, giving tax breaks, creating a regulatory framework for it. 
And of course, let's not forget that as important as regulation is that when a monopolist or would-be monopolist seeks regulation, the regulation they're often seeking is something that would prevent new entry. So the monopoly's first preference is usually not to be regulated at all, but their close second preference is 'regulate me in a way that only I and not my competitors can satisfy.' 
Is there any government in the world that either of you know of that is actually leading on regulation, specifically where AI is concerned? 
VB: Canada has tried to be fast in terms of defining when and how [we are] going to use artificial intelligence as a government. And I think that kind of rapid prototyping is important to have these statements and disclosure — how are we going to, who are we going to contract with on some of these issues. That's been very transparent. And it's almost like we're in an ideas competition because globally on what the frameworks should be, I use frameworks plural, but really because this stuff doesn't have a geography, we're sort of finding that kind of national, sub-national organizing principles don't work very well here. 


After that can you fix this summary that I wrote. There are a lot of mistakes:

Doctorow expressed skepticism toward the pervasiv optimism surronding AI, highlightening concerns about its potential societal consequenses, job displacment, and the assumptio of its superiarity over humans. He emphesized the need for AI to complement human intelligens rather than replase it entirly. Additinally, Doctorow questioned the efficency of standardized assesments in mesuring human abilities if AI can outform humans on such tests. Bednar emphasised the importans of AI regulation and transparancy in its development and usage, mentioing Canada's effors in defining AI's goverment use.

And I think that when you add up all of the consequential things that AI wants to automate in which they are both consequential and error-sensitive, such that you might be able to improve the outcome of the system by twinning or by pairing a human with AI, that the two of them work together with no cost savings, but an improvement in quality and in reliability, and you take those out because there\'s just no market for that stuff — what you\'re left with is a very small number of applications for AI.\nI have to admit a great amount of ignorance as to what is or isn\'t possible with artificial intelligence. I listened to a show recently where they talk about ChatGPT 4, which some researchers suggest can actually reason, can internalize an instruction to draw a unicorn when it\'s never seen a unicorn, or is able to pass the Turing test. Or the LSAT. How do I situate that in what you just said, Cory? \nCD: Well, okay, so if it turns out that the standard test that we give to lawyers is something that a chatbot can answer, maybe we\'re not assessing our lawyers very well, right? In fact, I would fully support the idea that any assessment that we use to measure the merit of a human that a chatbot can outperform should be scrapped as a measure, and we should go to better qualitative measures that may be harder to assess in bulk, but which would produce a better picture of what people\'s aptitudes and interests really are.\nI speak as a Canadian expatriate who lives in the United States and whose daughter is going through the Common Core curriculum, where about a third of her instruction hours are spent teaching her how to take standardized tests. So I think that we can agree that standardized assessment tools that began as a way to evaluate the conduct of education and where it could stand with improvement have become targets themselves. And there\'s a law, when a metric becomes a target, it ceases to be useful as either. \nI think it\'s really cool that with statistical inference you can figure out what a unicorn should look like even if you\'ve never heard of a unicorn. That\'s great. But I don\'t know that it tells you that there\'s something intelligent about it. I think it tells you something really interesting about what the limits of statistical inference are that is novel and cool and interesting philosophically. I just don\'t think that it justifies a mass retooling of society around inference engines that we know are prone to all sorts of gaffes and where every thought of a gaffe coming in is hand-waved away with this idea of humans in the loop.\nSo Vass, help me understand then why pioneers in AI like Geoffrey Hinton or Yoshua Bengio as well as leading companies and researchers, have implored governments to regulate. What do their concerns, you know, boil down to when it comes to AI? \nVB: I think we have this idea with artificial intelligence that if we regulate its production in a way that makes us all comfortable — we feel that it\'s ethical or moral or that it\'s being properly built, then we can worry a little bit less about the application side, right? Because we\'re kind of trying to have two conversations at once. How do we build and then how can we use this? \nIn terms of speaking to why AI pioneers are worried and sort of raising these flags, perhaps it\'s because it\'s their job to be ambitious and to dream about how this could be used or should be used and will be widely adopted. You mentioned large language models and us playing around with ChatGPT. I mean, is this not just mass user testing? We\'re sort of letting people play around and learn from models in what ends up being a race amongst the largest companies to have the dominant model and who are really kind of stuck in this cyclical kind of talent, circulation, poaching kind of people back and forth to build what is again, looking for efficiency. This idea we\'re going to do things if we do things faster, we\'re going to be able to do them better. If we just know a little bit more, we can make a slightly better prediction. And I think Cory\'s elements of complementing human work and human thinking is imperative. \nCD: There have been lots of critics before this current AI bubble who worried about automation bias and algorithmic bias. And when they criticize AI, when they do what is often called AI ethics, what they\'re saying is AI is not very powerful, right? AI can make a bunch of bad decisions quickly, so quickly that maybe we can\'t assess them. But that is not a mark of the quality and power of AI. \nMeanwhile, AI boosters who talk about AI safety as distinct from AI ethics, which boils down to someday the chatbot is going to wake up and turn us all into paperclips. What the subtext of what they\'re saying is, AI is so powerful that it needs to be regulated and if it\'s that powerful, it\'s probably very valuable as well, right? A tool that is this powerful will someday transform our whole economy in every single way. Your firm should be figuring out how to integrate AI into its processes. Governments should be finding lots of ways to encourage AI investment, giving tax breaks, creating a regulatory framework for it. \nAnd of course, let\'s not forget that as important as regulation is that when a monopolist or would-be monopolist seeks regulation, the regulation they\'re often seeking is something that would prevent new entry. So the monopoly\'s first preference is usually not to be regulated at all, but their close second preference is \'regulate me in a way that only I and not my competitors can satisfy.\' \nIs there any government in the world that either of you know of that is actually leading on regulation, specifically where AI is concerned? \nVB: Canada has tried to be fast in terms of defining when and how [we are] going to use artificial intelligence as a government. And I think that kind of rapid prototyping is important to have these statements and disclosure — how are we going to, who are we going to contract with on some of these issues. That\'s been very transparent. And it\'s almost like we\'re in an ideas competition because globally on what the frameworks should be, I use frameworks plural, but really because this stuff doesn\'t have a geography, we\'re sort of finding that kind of national, sub-national organizing principles don\'t work very well here. \n\n\nAfter that can you fix this summary that I wrote.

Artificial intelligence needs to work with humans — not replace us: tech experts
Don't buy all the hype — or hope — of AI, says tech writer Cory Doctorow
With ChatGPT, writing anything from resumes to thank-you notes, to even wedding vows, is a measure of how much artificial intelligence has become part of everyday life for millions of people. 
Advocates of AI see the technology as the potential answer to humanity's biggest problems. But skeptics warn AI could create lasting damage to our society — undermining education, eliminating jobs and perhaps civilization itself.
Technology writer and author of The Internet Con: How to Seize the Means of Computation, Cory Doctorow doesn't buy all the hype — or hope — associated with AI.
""The inevitabalism of technology going from 1 to 60, and then staying – sticking around forever. It's just not true… we discard technologies all the time, including technologies that people like, right?"" 
Doctorow joined Vass Bednar, executive director of the Master of Public Policy in Digital Society Program at McMaster University for a panel discussion about the promise and the perils of AI. The panel was moderated by IDEAS host Nahlah Ayed at the Provocation Ideas Festival in Stratford, Ontario in November, 2023.
Here is an excerpt from their conversation.
So what does it mean when we say that we're building machines that are smarter than we are? What does it mean for a machine to be smarter than a human being?  
CD: I think it means someone's lying, because given that we don't have a working definition of what smart means… you know, describing the computer as more spiritual than you or smarter than you or any other adjective that we don't have a good empirical definition for is like an intrinsically unfalsifiable statement.
Saying that we have a machine that can automate things, that can spot things that humans can't spot, that can work with a human as a kind of partner to catch things that humans miss, that's fine. But remember when they say, 'Oh, we've got an algorithm that catches some of the mistakes that radiologists make when they look at your lung X-rays,' what they don't mean is the radiologist is going to spend as much time as they ever did looking at lung X-rays, and they're going to get a second opinion from the algorithm which has different blind spots to the human, and they'll compare notes. And if it turns out that they don't agree, there will be one fewer X-ray looked at that day because the oncologist or the radiologist can go back and look at the X-ray again just to resolve that disagreement.
Nobody is investing in AI in the hopes that radiologists will spend more money looking at X-rays than they do today. They're investing in AI in the hopes that they will fire half the radiologists and double the rate at which they look at X-rays. And I think that when you add up all of the consequential things that AI wants to automate in which they are both consequential and error-sensitive, such that you might be able to improve the outcome of the system by twinning or by pairing a human with AI, that the two of them work together with no cost savings, but an improvement in quality and in reliability, and you take those out because there's just no market for that stuff — what you're left with is a very small number of applications for AI.
I have to admit a great amount of ignorance as to what is or isn't possible with artificial intelligence. I listened to a show recently where they talk about ChatGPT 4, which some researchers suggest can actually reason, can internalize an instruction to draw a unicorn when it's never seen a unicorn, or is able to pass the Turing test. Or the LSAT. How do I situate that in what you just said, Cory? 
CD: Well, okay, so if it turns out that the standard test that we give to lawyers is something that a chatbot can answer, maybe we're not assessing our lawyers very well, right? In fact, I would fully support the idea that any assessment that we use to measure the merit of a human that a chatbot can outperform should be scrapped as a measure, and we should go to better qualitative measures that may be harder to assess in bulk, but which would produce a better picture of what people's aptitudes and interests really are.

So I think that we can agree that standardized assessment tools that began as a way to evaluate the conduct of education and where it could stand with improvement have become targets themselves. And there's a law, when a metric becomes a target, it ceases to be useful as either. 
I think it's really cool that with statistical inference you can figure out what a unicorn should look like even if you've never heard of a unicorn. That's great. But I don't know that it tells you that there's something intelligent about it. I think it tells you something really interesting about what the limits of statistical inference are that is novel and cool and interesting philosophically. I just don't think that it justifies a mass retooling of society around inference engines that we know are prone to all sorts of gaffes and where every thought of a gaffe coming in is hand-waved away with this idea of humans in the loop.

Artificial intelligence needs to work with humans — not replace us: tech experts
Don't buy all the hype — or hope — of AI, says tech writer Cory Doctorow
With ChatGPT, writing anything from resumes to thank-you notes, to even wedding vows, is a measure of how much artificial intelligence has become part of everyday life for millions of people. 
Advocates of AI see the technology as the potential answer to humanity's biggest problems. But skeptics warn AI could create lasting damage to our society — undermining education, eliminating jobs and perhaps civilization itself.
Technology writer and author of The Internet Con: How to Seize the Means of Computation, Cory Doctorow doesn't buy all the hype — or hope — associated with AI.
""The inevitabalism of technology going from 1 to 60, and then staying – sticking around forever. It's just not true… we discard technologies all the time, including technologies that people like, right?"" 
Doctorow joined Vass Bednar, executive director of the Master of Public Policy in Digital Society Program at McMaster University for a panel discussion about the promise and the perils of AI. The panel was moderated by IDEAS host Nahlah Ayed at the Provocation Ideas Festival in Stratford, Ontario in November, 2023.
Here is an excerpt from their conversation.
So what does it mean when we say that we're building machines that are smarter than we are? What does it mean for a machine to be smarter than a human being?  
CD: I think it means someone's lying, because given that we don't have a working definition of what smart means… you know, describing the computer as more spiritual than you or smarter than you or any other adjective that we don't have a good empirical definition for is like an intrinsically unfalsifiable statement.
Saying that we have a machine that can automate things, that can spot things that humans can't spot, that can work with a human as a kind of partner to catch things that humans miss, that's fine. But remember when they say, 'Oh, we've got an algorithm that catches some of the mistakes that radiologists make when they look at your lung X-rays,' what they don't mean is the radiologist is going to spend as much time as they ever did looking at lung X-rays, and they're going to get a second opinion from the algorithm which has different blind spots to the human, and they'll compare notes. And if it turns out that they don't agree, there will be one fewer X-ray looked at that day because the oncologist or the radiologist can go back and look at the X-ray again just to resolve that disagreement.
Nobody is investing in AI in the hopes that radiologists will spend more money looking at X-rays than they do today. They're investing in AI in the hopes that they will fire half the radiologists and double the rate at which they look at X-rays. And I think that when you add up all of the consequential things that AI wants to automate in which they are both consequential and error-sensitive, such that you might be able to improve the outcome of the system by twinning or by pairing a human with AI, that the two of them work together with no cost savings, but an improvement in quality and in reliability, and you take those out because there's just no market for that stuff — what you're left with is a very small number of applications for AI.
I have to admit a great amount of ignorance as to what is or isn't possible with artificial intelligence. I listened to a show recently where they talk about ChatGPT 4, which some researchers suggest can actually reason, can internalize an instruction to draw a unicorn when it's never seen a unicorn, or is able to pass the Turing test. Or the LSAT. How do I situate that in what you just said, Cory? 
CD: Well, okay, so if it turns out that the standard test that we give to lawyers is something that a chatbot can answer, maybe we're not assessing our lawyers very well, right? In fact, I would fully support the idea that any assessment that we use to measure the merit of a human that a chatbot can outperform should be scrapped as a measure, and we should go to better qualitative measures that may be harder to assess in bulk, but which would produce a better picture of what people's aptitudes and interests really are.
I speak as a Canadian expatriate who lives in the United States and whose daughter is going through the Common Core curriculum, where about a third of her instruction hours are spent teaching her how to take standardized tests. So I think that we can agree that standardized assessment tools that began as a way to evaluate the conduct of education and where it could stand with improvement have become targets themselves. And there's a law, when a metric becomes a target, it ceases to be useful as either. 
I think it's really cool that with statistical inference you can figure out what a unicorn should look like even if you've never heard of a unicorn. That's great. But I don't know that it tells you that there's something intelligent about it. I think it tells you something really interesting about what the limits of statistical inference are that is novel and cool and interesting philosophically. I just don't think that it justifies a mass retooling of society around inference engines that we know are prone to all sorts of gaffes and where every thought of a gaffe coming in is hand-waved away with this idea of humans in the loop.
So Vass, help me understand then why pioneers in AI like Geoffrey Hinton or Yoshua Bengio as well as leading companies and researchers, have implored governments to regulate. What do their concerns, you know, boil down to when it comes to AI? 
VB: I think we have this idea with artificial intelligence that if we regulate its production in a way that makes us all comfortable — we feel that it's ethical or moral or that it's being properly built, then we can worry a little bit less about the application side, right? Because we're kind of trying to have two conversations at once. How do we build and then how can we use this? 
In terms of speaking to why AI pioneers are worried and sort of raising these flags, perhaps it's because it's their job to be ambitious and to dream about how this could be used or should be used and will be widely adopted. You mentioned large language models and us playing around with ChatGPT. I mean, is this not just mass user testing? We're sort of letting people play around and learn from models in what ends up being a race amongst the largest companies to have the dominant model and who are really kind of stuck in this cyclical kind of talent, circulation, poaching kind of people back and forth to build what is again, looking for efficiency. This idea we're going to do things if we do things faster, we're going to be able to do them better. If we just know a little bit more, we can make a slightly better prediction. And I think Cory's elements of complementing human work and human thinking is imperative. 
CD: There have been lots of critics before this current AI bubble who worried about automation bias and algorithmic bias. And when they criticize AI, when they do what is often called AI ethics, what they're saying is AI is not very powerful, right? AI can make a bunch of bad decisions quickly, so quickly that maybe we can't assess them. But that is not a mark of the quality and power of AI. 
Meanwhile, AI boosters who talk about AI safety as distinct from AI ethics, which boils down to someday the chatbot is going to wake up and turn us all into paperclips. What the subtext of what they're saying is, AI is so powerful that it needs to be regulated and if it's that powerful, it's probably very valuable as well, right? A tool that is this powerful will someday transform our whole economy in every single way. Your firm should be figuring out how to integrate AI into its processes. Governments should be finding lots of ways to encourage AI investment, giving tax breaks, creating a regulatory framework for it. 
And of course, let's not forget that as important as regulation is that when a monopolist or would-be monopolist seeks regulation, the regulation they're often seeking is something that would prevent new entry. So the monopoly's first preference is usually not to be regulated at all, but their close second preference is 'regulate me in a way that only I and not my competitors can satisfy.' 
Is there any government in the world that either of you know of that is actually leading on regulation, specifically where AI is concerned? 
VB: Canada has tried to be fast in terms of defining when and how [we are] going to use artificial intelligence as a government. And I think that kind of rapid prototyping is important to have these statements and disclosure — how are we going to, who are we going to contract with on some of these issues. That's been very transparent. And it's almost like we're in an ideas competition because globally on what the frameworks should be, I use frameworks plural, but really because this stuff doesn't have a geography, we're sort of finding that kind of national, sub-national organizing principles don't work very well here.
