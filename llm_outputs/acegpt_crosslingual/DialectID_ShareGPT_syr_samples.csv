Stable diffusion is a process in which particles move randomly through a medium, but the concentration of particles remains constant over time. The working principle behind stable diffusion is that the rate of particle movement is proportional to the concentration gradient of the particles.

In other words, the concentration of particles in a region of the medium is higher than the concentration in the surrounding regions. This gradient causes particles to move from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration, maintaining a constant overall concentration.
