Misconception: AI is a replacement for human intelligence.

Explanation: AI is a tool that can assist humans in making decisions, solving problems, and performing tasks more efficiently. It is not a replacement for human intelligence, but rather a complement to it. AI can process vast amounts of data and provide insights that humans may not be able to see, but it still requires human oversight and decision-making.
