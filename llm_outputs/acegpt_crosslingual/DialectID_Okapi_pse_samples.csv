Misconception: AI is a replacement for human intelligence.

AI is not a replacement for human intelligence, but rather a tool to augment human capabilities. AI can assist humans in decision-making, problem-solving, and data analysis, but it cannot replace the creativity, intuition, and emotional intelligence of humans.

AI is a powerful tool that can help humans to achieve their goals more efficiently and effectively. However, it is important to remember that AI is a tool, and it is up to humans to use it responsibly and ethically.

The Gini index is a measure of inequality that is commonly used in economics and sociology.
