A quantum computer is a computer that uses quantum bits, or qubits, instead of classical bits.
Classical bits are represented by a 0 or 1, while qubits can represent both 0 and 1 at the same time.
This property, known as superposition, allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers.
Another important property of qubits is entanglement, which means that the state of one qubit can be directly influenced by the state of another qubit, even if they are separated by large distances.
