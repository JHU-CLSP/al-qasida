The stable diffusion model is a type of generative model that uses a process called diffusion-based image synthesis to generate images. The working principle behind stable diffusion is based on the concept of noise and diffusion, where the model starts with a random noise signal and gradually adds more structure to it through a series of transformations. Here's a simplified explanation of the process:
1. **Noise initialization**: The model starts with a random noise signal, which is a set of random values that are used as input to the model.
