AI is also used in the medical field to help doctors diagnose diseases, in finance to help investors make informed decisions, and in education to help students learn more effectively.

There is a misconception that using AI to augment human capabilities will lead to the replacement of human workers by machines. This misconception is based on the idea that AI is a replacement for human intelligence and that machines will eventually surpass human capabilities. However, this is not the case. AI is designed to augment human capabilities, not replace them. AI can perform tasks that are repetitive, time-consuming, and require a high level of precision, freeing humans to focus on more complex and creative tasks that require human judgment and empathy.
