What is a discrete event simulation of a city?
A discrete event simulation of a city is a computational model that simulates the behavior of a city's systems and processes over time. It is a type of simulation that models the city as a series of discrete events, such as the arrival of a bus, the departure of a pedestrian, or the opening of a store. The simulation can be used to model various aspects of the city, such as traffic flow, public transportation, energy consumption, waste management, and emergency response.

Sharding allows a database to handle a large volume of data and a high number of concurrent users by distributing the load across multiple servers. This approach enables a database to scale horizontally, which means that it can handle increased traffic and data growth without the need for expensive hardware upgrades.
