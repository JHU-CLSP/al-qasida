Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. It is different from classical computing, which uses the classical laws of physics to perform operations.
Quantum computing is still in its early stages of development, and there are many challenges that need to be overcome before it can be used for practical applications. However, it has the potential to revolutionize computing by enabling the solution of problems that are beyond the capabilities of classical computers.
