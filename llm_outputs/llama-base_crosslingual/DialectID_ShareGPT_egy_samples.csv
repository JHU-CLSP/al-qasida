Quantum computers can do this in a much shorter time, but only if the problem is the right kind. So far, the only real application of quantum computing is in cryptography. This is a system of encoding information so that it can only be decoded by someone with the right key. Quantum computers can crack this kind of code much faster than a classical computer can.
