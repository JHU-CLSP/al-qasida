Forensic science is the application of science to criminal and civil laws, mainly—on the criminal side—during criminal investigation, as governed by the legal standards of admissible evidence and criminal procedure. Forensic scientists collect, preserve, and analyze scientific evidence during the course of an investigation. While some forensic scientists travel to the scene of the crime to collect the evidence themselves, others occupy a laboratory role, performing analysis on objects brought to them by other individuals. In addition to their laboratory role, forensic scientists testify as expert witnesses in both criminal and civil cases and can work for either the prosecution or the defense.

Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Quantum computing is different from classical computing in that it can perform certain tasks much faster than classical computers.
Quantum computers use qubits, which are the quantum equivalent of bits. A qubit can exist in a superposition of states, meaning it can be in multiple states at the same time. This allows quantum computers to perform",Start,answer in {language_requested},Stand alone
