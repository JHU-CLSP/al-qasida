The Gini index is calculated by taking the area between the Lorenz curve and the line of equality, which has a Gini index of 1, and dividing it by the area under the line of equality. This gives the Gini index a value between 0 and 1, with 0 representing perfect equality and 1 representing perfect inequality.

The Gini index is a measure of the inequality in the distribution of wealth or income across a population.

Gini coefficient is a measure of inequality that is used to measure the inequality in income or wealth distribution. It is calculated as the ratio of the area between the Lorenz curve and the line of equality to the total area under the line of equality. The Lorenz curve is a graphical representation of the cumulative distribution of income or wealth, where the x-axis represents the cumulative share of the population and the y-axis represents the cumulative share of income or wealth.
