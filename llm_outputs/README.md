# `al-qasida/llm_outputs`

Contains all raw model output files. (Files are in two different formats since some were created using Cohere's evaluation codebase and some with this codebase, but all are compatible with the software here; fix files are provided in failure cases.)

Files will be overwritten as you re-run your own analyses in `../eval`.
